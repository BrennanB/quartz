# What are They?

Sometimes you can have a smaller more compact [[Pit]] area where the [[Pit Crew]] can work on the robot beside the official field alongside the [[Drive Team]]. Usually this only happens at championship level events like the [[Ontario District Championship(DCMP)]] or [[World Championship(CMP)]] where you are given additional badging to allow more people field-side.
