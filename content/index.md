This is a wiki-like reference website for [[W.A.F.F.L.E.S.]] that uses [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for editing [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) text formatting and then publish it automatically on the web using [quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz).

It's used for general knowledge collecting, note taking, and lessons learned. Obsidian, and thereby the website links concepts and pages together, optimizing for searchability and usability for future reference. Linking things like [[Design]] concepts, [[Event Reviews]], and general procedures for 4476 for easy search and review when needed.

This site is still very much a work in progress and formatting is constantly changing and evolving.
