This is a sample organization thing for [[W.A.F.F.L.E.S.]] that uses [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for editing [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) text formatting and then publish it automatically on the web using [quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz).

I think it will be useful for general knowledge collecting, note taking, and lessons learned. Obsidian, and thereby the website links concepts and pages together, optimizing for searchability and usability for future reference. Linking things like [[Design]] concepts, [[event reviews]], and general procedures for 4476 for easy reference I think might be the best format for something like this.

I'm not really sure what the best format is for things, but I think it can generally be a fairly collaborative effort, and will help retain knowledge over years and serve as a good base for things in the future
