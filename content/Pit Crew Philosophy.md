# Communication

We have several expectations and goals for any [[Pit Crew]] communication. These goals are designed around having the most efficient possible actions as a whole unit.

## We Work as a Team

We communicate plans, insights, and issues clearly so that we can be efficient and effective.  We work together and delegate tasks as needed to get things done.

## Following Mentor Guidance

Decisions are made collaboratively in the [[pit]], but the [[pit crew]] is expected to follow the directions of the [[Pit Mentor|pit mentors]] when given as well as any final calls made by them.  The turnaround time between matches is often extremely tight, so it is imperative to trust the guidance of the leads.  Additional discussion and clarification can follow after the robot is sent to queue, when there is more time.

# We Aim to Prevent, Rather than Repair

We work as a team to ensure the robot is in the best possible condition before going out onto the field.  Our goal is to be diligent and prevent issues from occurring in matches, and quickly resolve them if they do occur.  This means that during downtime, when there are no known issues, we continue to inspect the robot and physically manipulate parts to identify potential problems before they happen.

# We Work Quickly & Carefully

Given the short time frame between matches, it is critical for the [[pit crew]] to have a certain amount of "hustle" while maintaining a keen attention to detail.  Think of the efficiency and diligence required of the pit crew for F1 teams. [[Pit]] members should be ready and willing to jump in and start a task at any time.

# Only Pit Members Are in the Pit

Space is extremely limited in the team's [[pit]] area and on the practice field. Only the [[Pit Crew]] members should be in the these areas, unless a team member is relaying information briefly or are called in by the lead [[Pit Mentor|pit mentors]].

Extra [[Mentors]], [[Student]], family members, and guests should remove themselves from the [[Pit]] when not needed. The [[Pit Mentor]] leads will monitor this and ask people to leave as required to prevent overcrowding.

# The Pit Crew Does the Repairs

The [[pit crew]] members perform repairs and maintenance on the robot, with the help of [[Topping Crew]] members as needed.  The [[drive team]] members inform the pit crew on any issues that occur in matches, but they do not work on the robot themselves.  We do this to minimize the workload on drive team members, and to give them time to do their [[match]] reviews.

# We Represent the Team

Members of the [[pit crew]] interact with judges, pit scouts, and members from other teams.  As such, they are expected to be positive and be professional.
