# Communication

We have several expectations and goals for any [[Pit Crew]] communication. These goals are designed around having the most efficient possible actions as a whole unit.

## We Work as a Team

We develop courses of action as a group, and clearly communicate those plans so that we can address them efficiently and effectively.  We work together and delegate tasks as needed to get things done.

## Following [[Mentor]] Guidance

Decisions are made collaboratively in the [[pit]], but the [[pit crew]] is expected to follow the directions of the [[Pit Mentor|pit mentors]] when given as well as any final calls made by them.  While they might not always be the best possible solutions, the turnaround time between matches is often extremely tight, so it is imperative to trust the experience and guidance of the leads.  Additional discussion and clarification can follow after the robot is sent to queue, when there is more time.

# We Aim to Prevent, Rather than Repair

We work as a team to ensure the robot is in the best possible condition before going out onto the field.  Our goal is to be diligent and prevent issues from occurring in matches, and quickly resolve them if they do occur.  This means that during downtime, when there are no known issues, we continue to inspect the robot and physically manipulate parts to identify potential problems before they happen.  This also means that we do not send the robot to the field with untested upgrades or code changes.

# We Work Quickly & Carefully

Given the short time frame between matches, it is critical for the [[pit crew]] to have a certain amount of "hustle" while maintaining a keen attention to detail.  Think of the efficiency and diligence required of the pit crew for F1 teams. [[Pit]] members should be ready and willing to jump in and start a task at any time.

# Only Pit Members Are in the Pit

Space is extremely limited in the team's [[pit]] area and on the practice field. Only the [[Pit Crew]] members should be in the these areas, unless a team member is relaying information briefly or are called in by the lead [[Pit Mentor|pit mentors]].

Extra [[Mentors]], [[Student]], family members, and guests should remove themselves from the [[Pit]] when not needed. The [[Pit Mentor]] leads will monitor this and ask people to leave as required to prevent overcrowding.

# The Pit Crew Students Do the Repairs

The [[pit crew]] students perform repairs and maintenance on the robot, with the help of [[Topping Crew]] members as needed.  The [[drive team]] members inform the pit crew on any issues that occur in matches, but they do not work on the robot themselves.  We do this to minimize the workload on drive team members, and to give them time to do their [[match]] reviews.

As with all areas of the team, the [[Mentor|mentors]] are there to guide and support the students, not to do the work themselves.  The mentors do not carry out a task that a student is capable of doing, and avoid being hands-on with the robot or code.

# We Represent the Team

Members of the [[pit crew]] are team ambassadors, as they have contact with judges, pit scouts, and members from other teams.  As such, they are expected to maintain a positive attitude, be professional when interacting with others, and show commitment to improving their presentation skills.
