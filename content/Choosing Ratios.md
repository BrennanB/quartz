# How to Select an Appropriate Gear Ratio

To select an appropriate ratio for a mechanism, we first need to set some baselines of what our mechanism should be able to do. Generally that comes down to two questions

- How much mass does it need to move?
- How fast does it need to move for a set common range?

## How Much Mass?

The simplest answer for some of these mechanism is simply how heavy is the thing you are trying to move? This can be solved by getting a [[weight estimate]] either through [[Solidworks]] or weighing actual parts on a scale (or a combination of both!).
