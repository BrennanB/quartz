# Types of Motors

Motors are divided primarily into brushless or brushed motors, named with regard to the internal systems of the motor itself. Brushless motors began being used in FRC in 2019, and are now widely considered superior to brushed motors. Each motor also requires a [[Motor Controller]].

These are the five [[FRC]] legal [[Brushless Motors|brushless motors]]:
- [[Kraken X60]]
- [[Falcon 500]]
- [[NEO Brushless V1.1]]
- [[Neo Vortex]]
- [[Neo 550]]

PLEASE NOTE: During prototyping early in the season, we will often 'jerry rig' motors to run using drill batteries and wiring them up. In this case, brushed motors **must** be used.

There are several [[FRC]] legal brushed motors. The most common are:
- [[Cim]] 
- [[Mini Cim]] 
- [[775 Pro]] 
- [[Redline]]

People will often joke about using #SnowblowerMotors or #WindowMotors. These are a real thing! They're incredibly underpowered, slow, and should never go on an FRC robot.
