Tube plugs are machined blocks that are put inside an extrusion that is used structurally in place of [[gussets]].

They are threaded so that parts can be bolted into the plug.

Tube plugs are often designed to be compatible with thick wall tubing (typically 1/8" wall), which would leave a small gap between the tube plug and the wall of a thin wall tubing (eg. 1/16" wall or 0.10" wall). A 3D printed sleeve can be used to fill this gap.
