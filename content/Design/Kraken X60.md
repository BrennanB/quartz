The KrakenX60 (aka Kraken) is a brushless motor made by [[West Coast Products]]. Released in October 2023, these are "high-power, high-performance motors" with "a number of features that set it apart from other brushless motors in the FRC market". It is generally seen as a sequel product to the [[Falcon 500]], without the removable shaft and made by a different vendor.

As there is a [[TalonFX]] [[Motor Controller]], the Kraken is compatible with [[PheonixPro]], which is a subscription based service by [[CTRE]] to improve motor performance.

Key features of the motor include a 15T [[Spline Shaft]] ( #SplineXS), which is differently sized compared to the [[Falcon 500]]. There are cooling ports available if needed, but this is possibly overkill, and an claimed operating efficiency above 84% from 15-40A.

Additionally, Krakens are compatible with an [[Anderson PowerPole]] adapter board. Instead of having wires which directly screw into the back of the motor, this board can be used to improve wire routing in certain applications.
