We maintain a library of generally [[COTS]] parts for ease of use that are already optimized to our own needs. We maintain this year to year and work on improving models that are frequently used year to year, like [[Motors]] so that they can be easily added to robot models. The parts library also contains a folder called "4476 SolidWorks Templates", which contains a few files that are required to support our workflow.
