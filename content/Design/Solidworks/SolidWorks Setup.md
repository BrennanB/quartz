To install SolidWorks, follow the instructions provided in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AAJ7ueWqx_pui89ytcHOLbipR8hLAZMzIT-uO9koAL8/edit#gid=0) (4476 members only).

Once SolidWorks is installed, there are a number of settings you can change to make life easier later on. These are mostly unrelated to each other, so here's a list of suggested settings changes ranging from most recommended to merely suggested:

**Mandatory (These are heavily used on the team, must complete for level 2 CAD certification)**
- [[Add File Locations]]
- Enable "[[Rename Components from Feature Tree]]"
- [[Get Better Measurements]]
- [[Setup Design Library]]
- [[Set Favorite Materials]]
- [[Enable Autosave]]
- [[Set up Document Template Prompts]]

**Suggested (Some fun settings that make SolidWorks better to use)**
- [[Enable Weldments]]
- Enable "[[Dimension on Entity Creation]]"
- [[Customize your tools]]
- [[Customize your shortcuts]]
