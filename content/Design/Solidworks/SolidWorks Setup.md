To install SolidWorks, follow the instructions provided in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AAJ7ueWqx_pui89ytcHOLbipR8hLAZMzIT-uO9koAL8/edit#gid=0) (4476 members only).

Once SolidWorks is installed, there are a number of settings you can change to make life easier later on. These are mostly unrelated to each other, so here's a list of suggested settings changes ranging from most recommended to merely suggested:

**Recommended (These will make life so much easier + make you CAD better)**
- [[Check Default Units]]
- Enable "[[Rename Components from Feature Tree]]"
- [[Add File Locations]]
- [[Get Better Measurements]]
- [[Setup Design Library]]
- [[Enable Weldments]]

**Suggested (Some fun settings that make SolidWorks a bit more fun/less painful)**
- Enable "[[Dimension on Entity Creation]]"
- [[Set Favorite Materials]]
- [[Customize your tools]]
- [[Customize your shortcuts]]
