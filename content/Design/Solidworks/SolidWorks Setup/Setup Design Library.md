The SolidWorks Design Library is a quick way to access common parts. For us, it would be beneficial to add the [[4476 Parts Library]] to the design library so that all COTs parts are easily accessible.

You're all set! The next time you're in an assembly and want to insert a parts library component, simply look for it in the Design Library and drag it into your assembly. You can also double click on a component to open it in a new window.

Feel free to add other folders to your Design Library if you think it'd be useful!
