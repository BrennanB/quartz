The SolidWorks Design Library is a quick way to access common parts. For us, it would be beneficial to add the [[4476 Parts Library]] to the design library so that all COTS parts are easily accessible. Once it's set up, you can simply drag components into your assembly.

To link the Design Library:
1. Open a Part file in SolidWorks
2. Click on the Design Library icon in the right side toolbar
3. Click Add File Location
4. Find the 4476 Parts Library folder on your computer
5. Select the folder, then click OK

You're all set! The next time you're in an assembly and want to insert a parts library component, simply look for it in the Design Library and drag it into your assembly. You can also double click on a component to open it in a new window.

Feel free to add other folders to your Design Library if you think they'd be useful!
