There are multiple reasons you may want to add a file location, so we're not going into that here. Regardless of what file locations you're trying to add, the steps will be similar:

1. Go to \[Settings -> System Options -> File Locations]
2. From the dropdown, select the type of folder you'd like to add (probably Document Templates or Weldment Sketches)
3. Click "Add...", then in the pop-up find whichever folder you'd like to add to the list, then click "Select Folder"
4. Click OD in the settings window and Yes if a message pops up asking to change your search path

You can start by adding:
- "4476 SolidWorks Templates" - add as a "Document Templates" folder
- "Weldment Sketches" - add as a "Weldment Profiles" folder
