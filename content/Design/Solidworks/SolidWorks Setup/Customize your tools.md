There are some commands that we find super useful that [[SolidWorks]] doesn't make very accessible by default. To move them to the floating toolbar:

1. Click the dropdown next to the settings icon and click "Customize"
2. Find the Commands tab and search for the tool you want to make accessible
3. Drag the tool icon to the floating toolbar (or any other toolbar)

The commands that you will probably use most are Measure, Mass Properties, and Normal To. Find each of these commands and drag them somewhere accessible.
