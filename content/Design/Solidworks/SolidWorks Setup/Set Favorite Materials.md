There are some materials you'll use quite often in FRC, so it's recommended that you repeat the above steps for these materials (and remove the rest):
- 5052-H32 (Some sheet metal parts)
- 6061-T6 (SS) (Most sheet metal parts + extrusion + some shafts)
- 7075-T6 (SS) (Some shafts)
- PC High Viscosity (Lexan)
- Printed PLA (3D printed PLA parts, requires you to [[Add File Locations]])
- Printed PA6-CF (3D printed carbon-infused nylon, requires you to [[Add File Locations]])

Now, when you're assigning a material to a part, you no longer have to search through the pop-up window for your material - just right click material and click on the material of your part.
