When you create a virtual part in an assembly in SolidWorks, by default it will use the generic part template which is not set up for use with our BOMs and workflow. By enabling this setting, you can create virtual parts in assemblies from our custom part templates.

Go to: \[Settings -> System Options -> Default Templates] then enable "Prompt user to select document template".
