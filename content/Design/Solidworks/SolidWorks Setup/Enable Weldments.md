You can [[design]] complex structures made out of aluminum box extrusion, but the result is often a complex assembly that's time consuming to make and hard to adjust. What you may want to use instead are weldments.

Weldments are a set of SolidWorks tools that lets you sketch a path, then generate an extrusion profile that follows your path. For a demonstration of how this works, watch the first 2 minutes of this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8zpMxDt7xc)

The first step to getting weldments set up is to download the [[4476 Parts Library]] (Check out the [[CacheCAD Setup]] page for how to add this library). Then, add the "Weldment Sketches" folder in the 4476 Parts library as a file location for "Weldment Profiles" (learn how to [[Add File Locations]].

You're ready to use Weldments! When using weldments, you'll mainly be using the profiles in \[Weldment Sketches -> 4476 Custom -> Aluminum Box Extrusion], but feel free to check out the hex shaft profiles and 8020 profiles that may come in handy for offseason projects.
