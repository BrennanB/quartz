## Set Up CacheCAD
1. Go to [CacheCAD download page](https://www.cachecad.com/download) , click "Download" then "Download" again
2. Click "Download anyway" when Google Drive's warning page appears (CacheCAD is community made and has not been approved by Microsoft or Google)
3. Open the downloaded "CacheCAD_setup.exe" file
4. If a blue box appears warning you that the file might be harmful, press "More Info" then "Run Anyway" to continue
5. The CacheCAD installer should open, click "Next", "Install" then "Finish"
6. Open CacheCAD and press "Sign in with Google", then use your @wafflesrobotics.com account to sign in. Make sure to press the check box to allow CacheCAD to have access to your Google Drive, then you can close the tab
7. Return to CacheCAD, there should be a window that pops up asking you where to store files. Click "Yes" (the default location works great)
8. There will be a window asking for your FRC team number, type 4476 and click "OK"

At this point, CacheCAD is fully installed! However, you need to set up the projects to be synced.

## Add a Project
1. Open whichever folder you would like to add to CacheCAD as a project (e.g. [[4476 Parts Library]], [2024 Robot](**https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Oa50fDq4VJdghUqWi0FEKeiQ9d7zKCKs**)) and copy the browser URL
2. Open CacheCAD, click on "New Project", paste the copied URL and click "OK"
3. Your folders are listed on the left. Double click on the project you want to work on
4. A window will appear saying a folder is being created, click "OK"
5. Once CacheCAD finishes loading the project, click on "Download Changes" then "Download Changes" again. It will take a while to download big projects like our parts library (patience!!!)

Start by creating a project for the [[4476 Parts Library]] and for the specific FRC robot for the corresponding season. You may need to create new CacheCAD projects for any other CAD tasks you are involved in.
