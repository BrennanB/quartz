It is inevitable that the robot or anything for that matter will break/have issues. This page is a general guide on how to find the root issue of the problem and guide steps on how to fix it. It will be divided into 3 sections: Mechanical, Electrical and Software. This document extends beyond FIRST. It can be helpful later in life. It will be written from a FRC perspective for sake of clarity.

# Mechanical 
1. Identify current issue (Is the part moving too much, is it not moving, is it moving slowly, is it disconnected)
	1. This stems from knowing the general design of what you are working on. It is important to know what part should be doing what. Where should each part be doing during the match.
2. Find what connection is at issue(where does it connect)
	1. Generally pieces on the robot do not malfunction due to material flaws. So find the nearest connection to the robot and any other connection
	2. If it is due to material flaws, identify where on the material the flaw is. Be cautious there may be more than one flaw
3. Identify what has gone wrong with the joint
	1. If it is intended to be a static joint, why is it moving. Did is lose rivets/bolts or glue separate
	2. If it is intended to be dynamic, why is it static or less dynamic. Has something come loose, is a bearing missing is another part of the robot in the way
	3. If it is a material flaw, try and identify what has happened, was there a large force on the component, is it subject to constant forces
4.  Isolate the issue to a particular area
	1. Sometimes, the issue on an arm may actually be caused by a part on the drivetrain, follow the components all the way back to the base to ensure no other issues are present. Many times on robots when one issue occurs, it can have a ripple and cause further damage to other parts of the robot. 
5. Identify the solution to the problem
	1. This sounds like the easiest step but is often the hardest
	2. It is **CRITICAL** to take how much time you have into account for this step. If there is a lot of time before the next match, fix it to its original structure if possible. If time is short, begin looking for "hacks" to ensure the robot is usable for the next match. (Some examples include: duct tape, wood blocks)
	3. Sometimes due to lack of resource's it may not be feasible to fix something completely at an event, regardless of how much time is available. In this case it is very important to remind everyone to have this fixed entirely once returned to the build space to ensure proper robot functionality.
	4. Additionally, if there is catastrophic damage to the robot, it is vital to get a mentor involved as it may require putting a mechanism "offline" for a match or the remainder of the event. As seen at Newmarket in 2023, the arm was forced to be unused for a couple matches. This decision should not be made lightly.
6. Fix the issue on the robot
	1. Utilize your solution from step 5 and implement it. 
7. Check and Double check your solution
	1. Did your solution bring the robot back to its original abilities?
	2. Will your solution last at least one match preferably more?
	3. Will this issue continue to arise?
8. Prevention
	1. Many things on the robot are not preventable, however it is important to note when something is and to remediate the issue
	2. For example: In 2022, if balls continue to get jammed in the intake when taking in 2. Someone should speak with the [[Drive Team]] and the [[Software|programming]] team to see if a solution can be made to avoid the problem.
