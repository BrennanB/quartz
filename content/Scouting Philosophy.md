# Data Quality First

Most of our scouting decisions are made around having the best possible data.

## No Data is better than Bad Data

Bad data gives you incorrect insights that you can be (incorrectly) confident in. We would much rather have no data and know that we are lost than have data, think it's good, but have it be vastly incorrect.

## Only Scout what you Need

4476 has a very minimalist approach to the number of things we scout broadly. If it doesn't apply to every team, target that [[scouting]] for the teams that need it.
