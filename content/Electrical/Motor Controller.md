What is a motor controller? Excellent question! These controllers work to regulate the operation of an electric motor and is responsible on your robot for making [[motors]] move. For brushed DC motors, the motor controller regulates the voltage that the motor receives, much like a light bulb. For [[Brushless Motors|brushless motor]] controllers such as the [[Spark Max]], the controller regulates the power delivered to each “phase” of the motor.

Only certain types of motor controllers are legal in [[FRC]]. 

Brushless Motor Controllers:
- [[TalonFX]] (Integrated into a [[Falcon 500]] or a [[Kraken X60]])
- [[Spark Max]]
- [[Spark Flex]]
