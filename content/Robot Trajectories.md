# What are Trajectories?

Trajectories are paths that a robot follows to autonomously drive to different points around the field in a fast and reliable way.
# Choreo Trajectories

[Choreo](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/introducing-choreo-a-new-approach-to-swerve-trajectories/445236) is a new trajectory library that specifically optimizes for path speed. In 2023 we used [PathPlanner](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/pathplanner-2024-beta/442364). A big advantage is that you don't have to tweak paths to make them faster. Current tweaking using PathPlanner you often make requests of the robot to follow a path that it physically cannot actually do. Choreo helps a lot in this case with getting fast paths up quickly.

>  PathPlanner gives you a lot more control over your path compared to Choreo, but as a result, you can make a path the robot just can’t physically follow. When you do this, you’re going to have to do a lot of testing and tweaking to get it to a point where the robot can follow it. I literally made PathPlanner, but it still takes our team hours to tweak and test paths to get them to a good spot. That’s just how it works. Choreo tries to remove a lot of that testing and tweaking time by calculating a path that the robot can actually follow accurately from the beginning.

The downside for Choreo is it's not able to run on the fly generation; meaning for tasks like aligning to a node in the 2023 game, we would have to use PathPlanner for that.
