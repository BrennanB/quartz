Below we have listed the expectations of all 4476 team members to be followed at all times. If you have any questions about these, feel free to ask a [[Mentor|mentor]]!

## General Etiquette

Team members must follow the rules of Team 4476.
- Team members must be respectful to everyone (whether they are present or not). Treat others like you would want to be treated!
- *[[FIRST]]* Core Values, Gracious Professionalism™ , Coopertition™, honesty, integrity and loyalty are fundamental aspects of being a team member.
- Team members are expected to arrive on time to [[meetings]], or communicate late arrival in #attendance in advance. Remember, 5 minutes early is on-time, and walking through the door at the meeting start-time is late.
- If a member leaves before a work session is over, they must spend at least 10 minutes cleaning up (or have permission to leave from an adult [[mentor]]).
- Students must let mentors know when they are leaving.
- React to all Slack messages in #important and #updates when you have read them
- React with your availability in #attendance ahead of time
- Excessive phone use is not appropriate during meetings or team events (using [[slack]], messaging parents for rides, etc. is fine, but please keep it reasonable and avoid gaming).
- Respect mentors. They are volunteers working hard and dedicating their time for your benefit.
- If you commit to a project, see it through. If you are unable to complete the commitment, notify a mentor or captain within a reasonable time.
- We love to see intense dedication to the team, but remember that your health is much more valuable than anything and you need to keep your grades up. Like all after-school activities, students are not allowed to participate in a build night if they missed school that day. Do not attend robotics meetings if sick; you need to rest and recover properly so you can return at 100%.
- Actively work to help others feel included, both in person and online
- Our meeting time is extremely valuable as it is limited. To make the most of our time together please keep comments during collective discussions relevant and brief to avoid interrupting the flow.
- Be aware that you are representing our team when you post online or talk to others at school. Keep comments positive and always check with the [[FRC]] Director before speaking on behalf of the team or making any commitments.
- Follow the [[Safety Expectations|safety expectations]]

## Public Displays of Affection


All [[Mentor|mentors]] and [[student]] members of 4476 are expected to maintain professional behaviour, both in public and at team meetings. As such, PDA (Public Displays of Affection) are not allowed.

Examples of PDA include (but are not limited to):

- Kissing
- Hugging
- Cuddling
- Caressing or touchiness
- Use of pet names

Use common sense with this rule, and if you have questions please ask the FRC Director (Brennan).

We expect members to apply these guidelines to themselves with the maturity of an adult mentor. Additionally, student and mentor relationships must always remain strictly platonic and professional. See [[FIRST]]’s [Youth Protection Policy](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/youth-protection-policy)  for more detail.

## Social Media

- As a primary method of reaching the community, sponsors, and other teams, W.A.F.F.L.E.S. Social media must represent the positive core values of the team. As such, these guidelines apply to both team and personal accounts.
	- NEVER make ANY negative comments about another team online, even under a pseudonym or if your account is not associated with the W.A.F.F.L.E.S.
- Check with FRC director before posting or acting on behalf of the team (i.e. CD posts, organizing design reviews, reaching out to potential sponsors, etc)  
- Avoid contentious topics online, but feel free to congratulate teams for their hard work or pass on other messages that are positive or compassionate!
- Access to team social media accounts is controlled by the lead mentors. Make sure you have had a potential post proof-read by a mentor on the team prior to posting to check for spelling/grammar errors, appropriate hashtagging, etc.
