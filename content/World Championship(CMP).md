# What is it?

The World Championship is the culminating event for the season of FRC. Teams qualify for it by winning District Championships or [[Regional Events]]. Typically the World championship has eight [[Divisions]] of play, featuring eight [[Official Fields]] for teams to compete on. The winners of all 8 divisions will then play an additional [[Double Elimination]] bracket to crown the World Champion. The final bracket is played on the coveted [[Einstein Field]]. The winning alliance will get reinvited to the following year's championship.
