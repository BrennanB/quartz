Here we try to document in depth understandings of old FRC games and relevant strategies. In general FRC games do not end in an optimized state for how they are played due to the game not being played for extremely long periods of times. We will still discuss more "optimal" playstyles that the FRC season didn't really conform to in the end of the season, even at the highest levels of plays.
