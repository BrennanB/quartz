The pit area is where the [[Pit Crew]] work on the robot to do fixes, maintain the robot, and do [[System Checks]] to ensure the robot is working at peak performance. Typically it is an assigned 10x10 area where the team will also display team branding, awards materials, and store it's [[Tools]] to work on the robot.

[[Judges]] will also visit the pits throughout the competition days to complete their [[judging]] for [[Awards]] for the competition.
