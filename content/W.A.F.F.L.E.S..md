# Who We Are

W.A.F.F.L.E.S. Community Robotics is a not-for-profit, volunteer-operated organization located in Kingston, Ontario Canada.  We have a family of community-based _FIRST_ Robotics programs for youth aged 6 through 18, which are open to anyone in the area who does not have a team at their school.  Our teams are supported by a group of [[sponsors]] and [[mentor]]s who are [[alumni]] or community professionals.  We also run LEGO robotics summer camps and are a part of many community events to promote STEM in our area.

# The W.A.F.F.L.E.S. Acronym

One of the most common questions we get is, “What does W.A.F.F.L.E.S. stand for?”  It stands for Wild About Family & Friends Learning Engineering & Science.  The name was the idea of our original LEGO robotics team, and we have since expanded to include many more robotics programs.

# Our Mission

Our mission is to ignite and fan a flame of passion in young people for STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts and math) and business, by engaging them in exciting mentor-based programs that inspire innovation and personal growth, fostering well-rounded life capabilities including self-confidence, communication, leadership, and teamwork.
