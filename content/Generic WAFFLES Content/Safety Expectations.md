## Safety Glasses

Safety Glasses are mandatory in the competition pits, when fieldside, and when operating any power tools. The team has safety glasses that members can borrow at [[meetings]] and events, or you can buy your own (some even come with fancy rhinestones!). Failure to wear safety glasses will result in temporary removal until the situation is remedied. 
## Horseplay

No horseplay. Workspaces must be used responsibly and machinery treated with respect. Failure to respect these spaces will result in the team member being asked to leave the space. Examples of horseplay include (but are not limited to):

- Mock fighting
- Pranks
- Running or chasing
- Throwing objects
- Jumping or climbing
- Distracting others
- Blocking pathways
- Use of equipment for fun  
## Machinery

Machinery in the shop is to be respected and used responsibly. It is not to be used without adult supervision. If a [[student]] is unfamiliar with certain machinery, they should ask a [[mentor]] for an explanation of how to use it. If a machine should malfunction or a student has problems using a machine, notify a mentor immediately. Remember if you plug it in or turn it on, it is your responsibility to unplug it or turn it off.
### Safety Instructions

It is critical to listen to instructions from mentors on how to operate equipment. Repeated misuse of equipment may result in revocation of equipment privileges.  
### Dress

While working with any powered equipment, the following is required:
- Closed toed shoes
- Safety Glasses
- Long pants
- Hair pulled back from face and above shoulder level
- No loose clothing, including hoodie ties
- No jewelery
- It is advisable to wear clothing that may get dirty

At the [[Kingston Robotics Lab]], safety shoes/boots are required when in the [[Pit]] area or when working with machinery.
