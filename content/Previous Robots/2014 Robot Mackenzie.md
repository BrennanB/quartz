## Team Abilities

2014 was the first year the robot was designed prior to manufacturing. The team had an influx of new strong [[Mentor]]s who were alumni of other teams. This year the team invested in a small tabletop [[Drill Press]] and had a few parts that were manufactured by a local engineering firm. The rest of the robot was [[COTS]] or made with simple hand tools much like [[2013 Robot Aunt Jemima]].

## Robot Name

The robot was named after Mackenzie who was a family friend of one of the families on the team. This started our whole partnership with OneMatch and naming our robot after someone in need each year.
## Fun Lore

- Our first match of the year holds the world record for scoring (with penalties) [watch it here](https://www.thebluealliance.com/match/2014onto_qm4)
- We totally broke this robot! We put stiff surgical tubing on the linkage and it dramatically broke itself instead of stretching the tubing.
- It had a very useless hard-stop piston that we had only put on because a [[Robot Inspector]] told us to, but then we accidentally forgot to deactivate the piston and it turned on during the match and broke itself :)
- First event win!
- "Why is there one blue wheel on the intake?" "Because we were poor!"
- We built a shooter protoype inside a house that was too large to fit out the door, so instead we practiced by shooting out the door.
# The Robot

![[Pasted image 20231016184506.png]]


The robot was heavily inspired by the [Ri3D team Oryon Labs Robot](https://youtu.be/LSXEHBHmIn0?si=3Gu8ECMJ56mddALE) in overall structure, though much of the actual robot was modified adding other concepts in. Our robot featured a motorized single joint for pivoting the arm up and down, a [[Choo Choo Mechanism]] [[Shooter]]. Top rollers and guides to center the yoga ball, and pneumatic arm to add or remove contact with the ball and the top roller during pick up or shooting phases.
