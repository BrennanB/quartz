## The Game

## Team Abilities
In terms of team members for the 2020 season, we had 4 strong CAD students and experienced [[Mentor|mentors]] for [[design]], mechanical, and [[electrical]].  We had [[Sponsor|sponsors]] for laser cutting for metal and waterjet for [[Polycarbonate|lexan]] parts.  This was the first year that we had structural 3D printed parts (PLA), and our second year of using a [[Limelight]].

# The Robot

![Tanner 2020](https://i.imgur.com/S4GuVV4h.jpg)

The robot had a west coast drive with a [[ground pickup]] on a virtual four bar, feeding into a funnel for indexing with a 5-ball capacity.  It had a Limelight for vision tracking and could score in the high goal, using a hood with two positions.  It was short enough to go through the trench.  The climber had a virtual four bar deployment with a winch.  It had an [[electrical]] box to house most [[electrical]] components.
## Mechanical [[Design]]

### [[Drive Train]]

The West coast [[drive train]] had 6 wheels with a centre drop and ran on 4 [[Falcon 500|Falcon]] [[motors]].  This was the first time we used [[brushless motors]] and our first experience with [[Falcon 500|Falcons]].  The standard 6" high grip wheels from [[AndyMark]] were used.  A metal baseplate was used for the first time.

During a practice session, when the robot was spinning, the battery was ejected from the robot and caused backdriving in the [[Falcon 500|Falcons]].  This fried some of the [[electrical]] components ([[Limelight]], VRM, PCM).  This issue was later fixed in a firmware update.  The bolts on the output shafts of the [[Falcon 500|Falcons]] required [[loctite]], which was difficult to perform maintenance for due to small clearances, and required significant disassembly.

During our competition, we did not have any issues with the drivetrain.

### [[Intake]]

The intake deployed via a piston-actuated virtual four bar and had 3 rollers; the first had [[AndyMark]] compliant wheels and the following two were ABS pipe rollers with 3D printed hubs.  The rollers were powered by a bag [[Motors|motor]].  The side plates were made of [[Polycarbonate|lexan]] to absorb impacts and they were spaced using 3D printed spacers.

There were no dead zones in the geometry, but we found that the compression was too high (or a stronger [[Motors|motor]] was required) when doing high speed pickups and the balls would make contact with the bag [[Motors|motor]].  We had grip on the first roller for better pickup and at different heights depending on where balls were on the field, but found that the subsequent rollers did not need additional grip.  The shafts went through both of the rollers for rigidity, but for similar designs in the future, a dead axle [[design]] could be tried.  We had issues with overtightening the bolts connecting the [[Polycarbonate|lexan]] side plates, causing the spacers to crack and need replacement.  The deployment worked well, but we would increase the robustness of the metal used in the four bar, as the metal plates bent with use ([[intake]] impacting with walls).  The turn buckles for the chain tension on the virtual four bar worked well, but would loosen over time (see second image in the funnel section).  The [[intake]] also relied on the bumpers as a hard stop, but the bumpers were not made with high precision so the intake geometry needed to be adjusted.
### [[Funnel]]

One side of the funnel had a polycord [[belt]] to agitate the balls and push them into the conveyor.  It went from a width equivalent to two balls wide down to one ball wide.  Three balls could be stored in the funnel at a given time.

We had issues with balls falling out because there was no [[Polycarbonate|lexan]] top in the actual version, due to weight limitations.  Metal [[pulleys]] were originally used, but were swapped to crown pulleys to avoid damaging the balls.  Extra lexan was added to the [[intake]] to better guide the balls into the funnel and prevent balls from falling out.  The funnel mounting design was not optimal for maintenance, as the lexan blocked access.  The plate on the top side of the polycord [[belt]] would dig into the ball and limit proper contact/indexing.

### [[Conveyor]]

The conveyor fed the balls indexed by the funnel into the [[shooter]] using polycord [[Belt|belts]] on 3D printed crown [[pulleys]], and it was powered by another bag [[Motors|motor]].

The transition from the funnel to the conveyor was not fully planned, and thus there were issues with geometry and dead spots.  The crown [[pulleys]] were not perfectly aligned, causing the polycord [[Belt|belts]] to slip off frequently.  Ball jams frequently occurred in the conveyor.
