### Drive Train

This year we used a standard [[VEX]] based [[West Coast Drive]]. Was a [[6 Wheel Drop Center]] 6 [[Mini Cim]] drive train. This robot continued to use the [[AndyMark]] HiGrip wheels for driving. The frame on the front of the robot had a cutout to allow for Cargo balls to enter the robot easily, and the [[Baseplate]] was a simple 1/4" polycarbonate sheet to add some rigidity to the frame.

For the most part the [[Drive Train|drive train]] was pretty bullet proof. One concern early on in the season was how the wheels would hold up coming off of hab level 2 in autonomous, though we never saw damage from that. We did see regular damage from trying to "yeet climb" where we would drive full speed using the ramp of level 1 hab to barely make it up to level 2 of the hab. Several wheels cracked over time because of this, and we had to replace them.
