# General

- [ ] New recruitment video
- [ ] Increasing positive reinforcement
- [ ] More social activities, especially in the off-season ([[Season Timeline]])
	- Game nights, escape rooms, dinners, etc.
- [x] Use [[Kingston Robotics Lab]] location after the robot is built
	- Tools, practice space, setup a [[Pit]] to work in for good practice

# [[Pit]] Area

- [ ] Talked about [[Pit]] food - having pit snacks?
- [x] Stocking [[tools]]
- [x] [[Colour Coding]] [[Tools]]
	- [ ] Indicate head type on Allen key labeling
- [x] New toolbox on robot cart
- [ ] Remove everything except the best/necessary tools and equipment from the toolbox, updating the packing list accordingly (reduce overpacking, make it much easier to see and find the tools that we really need)
- [x] Reorganize toolbox and yellow organizers for better use of space
	- [ ] Drawer separators for the big tool chest
- [ ] Try having 3 pit [[Student|students]] and 2 [[Pit Mentor|pit mentors]]
	- [ ] 3 separate checklists - one for each student
- [ ] Robot cart
	- [ ] Add a lip on the cart to keep the toolbox in place
	- [ ] Make cart less symmetrical and put the robot on in the same orientation each time (eg. intake facing the side with the toolbox for close access)
	- [ ] Add a spool for the ethernet cable
	- [ ] Look at shortening cart for easier maintenance and lifting (rail height, wheel height?)

# [[Scouting]]

- [x] Putting data online for ease of access
- [ ] Revamping [[Data Validation]]
	- [ ] Each stat for each team has an associated error
	- [x] [[Pit Scouting]] to generate flags for each team
	- [ ] Use flags to compare to inputted data to see if data matches flagged ability (ex. team scores high cone, but flags say they can't)
- [x] Personal [[Pick List]] online
	- [ ] Automatically merge into one [[pick list]] for [[Scouting Meeting]]
- [ ] Convert all features from current Excel sheet to online
- [x] New [[scouting]] tablets (from summer camp)
- [ ] Check over /teams/XXXX for when db is accessed and why no data brakes the page
- [x] Fix pushing that duplicates stuff
- [ ] When displaying numbers, round to sig figs
- [ ] Don't display "no comments" comments
- [x] Some sort of search bar somewhere to select a team
- [ ] Link teams on analysis page to team page
- [ ] Make urls for specific views
- [ ] fix average game pieces, currently says no matches played
- [ ] have a way to update robot picture

# [[Strategy]]

- [x] [[Slack]] threads for every quals [[match]] and [[Eliminations|elims]] alliances.

# [[Drive Team]]

- [x] Record matches from behind the glass

## Reducing Stress Levels

1. Doing something fun completely unrelated to robots to disrupt potentially negative thinking
2. Better structure around focusing one [[match]] at a time. It's fine to briefly think about the future, but the now is always more important.

# Robot
## [[Design]]

### General

- [ ] Break down [[Priority List]] with individual requirements for the [[Mechanism|mechanisms]], but separate from the list.
- [x] Try 3D printed [[Tube Plugs]]
- [x] Try 3D printed bearing hats (go over flange, rivet/bolt to plate).  We had issues throughout the season with the bearings on the intake popping out.
- [ ] Try iron on [[Bumpers|bumper]] numbers (offset to one side to make it easier for the reversible design) - bumpers took a harsh beating this year

### [[Prototyping]]


- [x] Try the Spectrum Protopipe system for [[Prototyping|prototypes]] (PVC pipes with 3D printed fittings)

### CAD

- [ ] [[Crayola CAD]] (block in basic shapes, refine over time)
- [ ] CAD and create spacers for hex shaft that isn't hex to make it easier to align
- [ ] Use [[SolidWorks]] analysis tools
	- [ ] FEA analysis to understand failure points and rigidity
	- [ ] Collisions as a quick check for any collisions/intersections

### [[Design Reviews]]

- [ ] More frequent and structured design reviews (see [[Design Process Improvements for 2024]])

### [[Manufacturing]] & Assembly

- [ ] Part and [[Assembly]] [[Drawings]] for in-house parts
	- [ ] Make sure we have drawing templates set up again
- [ ] Map out/plan for spacers
- [x] Master spreadsheet for part [[manufacturing]]
	- [ ] Manufacture in order of assembly
- [ ] Make full spare systems (eg. swerve module, [[intake]])
- [x] Do test holes in aluminum and [[Polycarbonate|lexan]] to find the right drill sizes for us
	- [x] Bearings (press fit)
	- [x] 3/16 rivets
	- [x] 10/32 clearance
	- [x] 8/32 clearance
	- [x] Â¼-20 clearance

## [[Electrical]]

- [x] Investigate [[Hall Effect Sensors|hall effect sensor]] wiring with the [[Kraken X60|kraken]]
- [x] Wire [[2023 Robot Misha and Zoey]] with [[canivore]] and pidgeon


## Programming

- [ ] 

## Purchasing

- [ ] Have a spreadsheet with the subteam leads being responsible for making sure things are purchased on their respective tabs
- [ ] Have list of people who are willing to put things on credit cards
- [ ] Order before the season starts
	- [ ] Metal, lexan
	- [ ] Rivets
	- [ ] Washers
	- [ ] Bolts (look at grades, can ask Andy)
