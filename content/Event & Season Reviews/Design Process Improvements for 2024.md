# Managing priority list, big picture, deadlines

## Prototyping
- Try Spectrum’s PVC prototype kit
- Start CAD while prototyping - just to map things out and get a better vision
	- Blocky
	- Expected to change
- Design Reviews
	- Structured reviews
	- Internal
		- Generally every couple of days
		- Go through checklists and make sure everything has been reviewed before moving onto the next stage
	- External
		- Have at each stage of the process - like 3 times or something?

## Phase 1: Design Concept
- Simplicity (num of motors, combining parts, degrees of freedom, foolproofing the assembly, etc.)
- Manufacturing feasibility/process (designing within our manufacturing means)
- Geometry (pathing, dead spots)
- Packaging
	- Max extension
	- Maximum height
	- Frame perimeter
- Layout of mechanisms
- Checking calculations
	- Motor math
	- C-C distances, pathing and accessible tensioning
- Power budget (num of motors running at once, num of slots being used)
- Electrical integration
	- Sensors
	- Wire routing
	- Space for electrical components
- COG/tippiness
- General maintenance (eg. avoid needing to take a lot of the robot apart to do a replacement)
## Phase 2: Design Details
- Fasteners
- Hole sizes
- Clearances
- Maintenance (hand access, tool access, modularity, etc.)
	- Longevity?
	- Supports/cross members and weak spots (thickness/snapping, orientation of cheese holes, etc.)
- Mechanical
- Look at switching to REV MAXplanetary
- Give swerve motors back to Leia for defense in drive practice
- Manufacturing and Assembly
	- Part drawings for parts that are manually machined
	- Assembly drawings, yay!
	- Map out or cad spacers
		- Maybe print custom length spacers?  Would reduce modularity but would make assembly more foolproof
	- Spreadsheet tracking for parts needing to be manufacturing
	- Have a BOM as we go
	- New tools (allen keys, ratcheting wrenches)
		- Organized!!!!!!!!! Placed strategically
	- Make full spare systems (e.g. intake)
	- Teach more students how to CNC
	- Do CAM online and remotely
- Manufacture in assembly order
- Design leads determine assembly order in a master spreadsheet
- Purchasing
	- Have more people involved
	- Subteam leads responsible for their own tabs in spreadsheet
	- Have list of people who are willing to put things on credit cards
	- Diligent about part numbers and quantities
	- Order before the season starts
		- Metal, lexan
		- Rivets
		- Washers
		- Bolts (look at grades, can ask Andy)
		- REV MAXplanetary
		- More yellow organizers
		- 3D printer?
- Electrical
	- Label everything
	- Have a student who knows electrical systems be involved in design
- Categorize
	- Must never fail (chassis, superstructure)
	- Shouldn’t fail, but can be replaced easily if it does
## Random other notes
- Have clearance charts up on the walls (CAD and manufacturing)
- Do test holes in aluminum and lexan to find the right size for us
	- Bearings (press fit)
	- 3/16 rivets
	- 10/32 clearance
	- 8/32 clearance
	- ¼-20 clearance
- Offseason Projects
- High priority (Next Monthish):
	- Integrate new CTRE system in 2023 robot before STEMley
	- Tool chest reorganization (Color coding, tool container change - Eden led)
	- Order tools in the week of Sep 24-30 (Brandon)
	- Drawer separation
	- Filtering through useful tools (Quinton)
	- 8-32 & 10-32 reorganization
- Mid priority(Definitely do before build season):
	- Design lead elevator project
	- Experienced student projects (Kenneth)
	- New student swerve project (Daniel led)
	- Modular weights, used for future prototyping
	- Practice improved design process
	- Regular design reviews
	- Drawings
	- Robot cart upgrades (hold tools, batteries, driver station, etc)
	- Better autonomous reliability
	- Logging variables for the robot
- Low priority (Expect to do before build season):
	- New 3DP tube insert (New student, Brandon led)
	- General workspace organization
	- Reference sheet with color codes, allen key sizes, wrench sizes, tap sizes, clearance hole sizes (Eden)
	- Testing/maintenance autos
	- Update reference documents
## Team Suggestions Consensus
### Good
- Robot cart tools
- Off limits when building robot, use when maintaining
- Mark differently to pit tools
- Clecos
	- Open to using them, could be useful
- Swapping Andersons for WAGOs
	- Worth a try
	- Could be useful for quick fixes
- Tube plugs
	- Order as needed
- Bonded wire
	- Buy whatever is cheaper
- Buy new brushless motors that come out (Probably WCP)
	- Not too concerned about motor issues as we can revert to old motors
	- Will need to budget out a good amount for
- Use CacheCAD
	- Interfaces with gdrive
	- Looks good!
### Maybe
- Mini lathe
	- Useful if there are leftover funds
### Not right now
- Ferrules for small wires
	- Not necessary as per expressed by Electrical team
- Chop saw
	- Not necessary
- Colson drive wheels
	- Stick with tread
	- More regular maintenance, hole punch screw holes, get jig
- Mini mill
	- Not worth the money currently
- Tooling in organizers
	- Not necessary
	- Workflow: take out organizer, see red, get red wrench and red allen key
