## Scouting Review

### General Thoughts
The scouting system half functioned with our new website. 

Remember to bring power brick for [[scouting]] laptop

Allocate a phone for data to push stuff, check to see if it works on apple.

Communicate with scouts about event-strategy channel threads and can input on match planning

Look into sim card dongle data thing so we don't have to sacrifice a phone, team could get a cheap data plan

### What Worked
- Tablet app worked well
- Server app scanning
	- csv generation
- [[Match]] Schedule
  The website just started working after match 14.
- Analysis page was decent

### What Broke
- Broke after match 28
- mass duplication of matches
### To Fix (tracked on [[Implement for 2024]])
- [ ] Check over /teams/XXXX for when db is accessed and why no data brakes the page
- [ ] Fix pushing that duplicates stuff
- [ ] When displaying numbers, round to sig figs
- [ ] Don't display "no comments" comments
- [ ] Some sort of search bar somewhere to select a team
- [ ] Link teams on analysis page to team page
- [ ] Make urls for specific views
- [ ] fix average game pieces, currently says no matches played
- [ ] have a way to update robot picture


## Pit Review

### General Thoughts
- Three pit students was good
	- Role of each student would be better defined during the season next year (2/3 pit students had been in the pit and were used to working as a pair)
	- Allowed for an extra person to take over a checklist if needed
	- Wasn't as strenuous on each person
- Didn't need as many batteries as we brought (at least for a 1-day event)
	- Could have brought only enough to fit on the battery charger station
	- Only cycled through a handful of batteries - partly because they are taken right off the charge and we can only have 3 plugged in at once
- Pit management was good
- Generally still overpacking
	- Go through and remove things from toolbox, totes, milkcrates
	- Further cut down packing list
	- Get rid of bad stuff

### What Worked
- Meeting DT fieldside post-match
- Reasons for practice field visits were generally communicated well (could still be a bit better)

### What Broke/Went Wrong
- Wagos eating wires on intake (not enough slack)
- Intake bearings popping out
	- Do bearing hats
- Glued connections came loose
	- Add to checklists, maybe redo between events

### To Fix
- Have one DT member go with the robot to queue if possible (not just pit)
- Make sure pit knows where DT does their match reviews
- More communication between DT/technician to pit crew
	- Details on issues and any theories
	- Also say if everything seemed good
	- Ensure communication is calm and accurate as much as possible (intake did not disintegrate)
- Definitely spool ethernet cable or it's way too long
- Practice field
	- Leave early to be ready to load on right at our time slot
	- Prep everything possible before going on to maximize full slot
	- Time is very limited on the practice field at in-season events
- Make sure everyone knows what to take to the practice field
- Follow up on borrowed items earlier
- Keep track of/label spares and used items so that they don't get put back on if they aren't good (eg. spare neos that were cycled through)
- Bearing hats (bearings popping out)
- Unpack totes between events (to ensure we don't overpack)
