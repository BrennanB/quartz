**2022 Debrief Notes**

Schedule:



* Allow for more time between opening ceremonies and the first judging session.
* Allow longer between the last match and closing ceremonies for deliberations.  Advertise this to the parents ahead of time.
* Need to book a set up time much earlier.
* Print all materials earlier….ie two weeks before.

Activities:


* Rotating activities worked well but the activities need more active oversight.  For example 6 bricks were packed up a mess and clearly not being used for intended purpose.

Need to Remember:


* We need a printer at the event.

Clean Up:

* First load before event ended worked well
* Pizza after the second load was good so let’s make it more official next year.
* It was too hard to divert things between W.A.F.F.L.E.S. HQ and Street Health.
* Someone needs to oversee Activities Packing

Consider:

* Expanding to 24 teams and using the auditorium for matches and awards with the gym for pits and activities.
* Helping Wendy D find a replacement teacher.  (LEGO is at her house.)
* Having a blocked off area to stage activities and only bring out one or two at a time.  Have a volunteer in charge of each activity so they only have to be the lead when their activities are out.
* Red/Green volunteer t-shirts with LEGO man parts of a volunteer labeled
