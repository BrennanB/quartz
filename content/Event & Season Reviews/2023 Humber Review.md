# Things People Enjoyed/Found Fun
- Anna: Perfect Winning Streak, and when Karthik kept saying 'Still Undefeated', a great high score
- Zach: Our autos (being better than at #newmarket), we had a good design that held up, felt like we were much more organized here than before which was a big win
- Meaghan: When things broke we were still winning because we would fix it
- Finlay: The last couple of matches, it kinda sucked how the arm broke but Benjamin playing defense was good
- Ibrahim: Talking to teams and judges, Kenneth getting safety all-star again (it's an honour to be in his presence)
- Kenneth: Also liked talking to teams and [[Judges]], atmosphere in the [[Pit]] was good (a little crowded tho)
- Kevin: Good strategy and selecting the pick, alt f4 carrying in finals 2
- Eden: Preventing problems from happening more often than prev events, the general pit management was good
- Brennan: Different people we had in charge of each section were very strong and maximized what we could do with the experience we had
- Cynthia: Games were fairly consistent, drivers were awesome, and the shark made her day
- Edward: Liked seeing what all the other robots were and what teams came up with
- Ender: The toaster, on stream it seemed like people were having fun/were energetic even as the days went on
- Quinton: Efficient system of leads and students being in right places to maximize the skills
- Samuel: Even tho the robot broke several times we were still undefeated
- Sylvan: The scouting system efficiency felt really organized and not broken, liked it being fast and easy
- Dorothy: Kept bracing myself for things going wrong but instead we kept winning
- Darryl: Taking the time leading up to the event time coming in early over the break and getting prepared, comments Finlay made about team morale, team spirit
- Taegen: [[Pit]] leadership, scouting improvements (go Logan), drive team performance under pressure, picking a team who we actually helped pass inspection, Ibrahim getting to lead up a strat

| Seats were best we could get                                                                               | Seats still weren't great, thx humber                                                                                         |
| Scouting meeting was fun, run better than last time with speed/organization                                | Still not sure what 'good or bad' was, felt distanced from scouting meeting                                                   |
| Scouting system ran better than last time                                                                  | Did get distracted at scouting meeting, side conversations                                                                    |
| Much better initial lists to work from at picklist meeting (would like to be able to make an average list) | Was annoying to look thru teams individually, wasn't a lot of time between matches to do data pull                            |
| Scouts were better at being on time, still significant room for improvement                                | If we keep using trello, we might want an individual device for than instead of someones phone                                |
| Logan did very well                                                                                        | Should get someone non-strategy to record matches because it's hard to focus on watching (for debrief) and recording well     |
| High %of student engagement for scouting                                                                   | Improve on comment quality, maybe try a qualitative scouting practice exercise                                                |
|                                                                                                            | Try to add team photos into team lookup for scouting meeting                                                                  |

# Drive Team

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Drive Team Went Well|Drive Team things to Improve|
|Felt better after having practice time, built skill and confidence which had direct result on how well we did|Finlay: Want more contingency plans (small ones) - like what to do if people are falling off, should figure out alignment for robot cart better|
|liked how the lights worked for better communication|Edward: driver station wire management is lacking in existence|
|getting robot on/off field went smoothly, no major hiccups|Meaghan: was alone to drive robot post-match, need pit crew (@kenneth) to come out to assist at field exit|
|did actual match review (hooray) which helped improvement throughout the event,|communication can still be a bit better (specifically with cone placements, driver operator communication can still be improved to speed up cycles) - unclear who has to make adjustments (sometimes it's arm, sometimes it's robot, practice that more)|
|played relatively slow and didn't rush, dropped like 2 pieces the whole event)|Some problems with setpoints drifting over the course of the event, need to improve accuracy - chain deterioration|
|human player pickups were very good at the end|should discuss as a DT on how to reduce stress and remaining calm throughout a match since we still had some panic|
||still hitting HP shelf guard|
||Brennan didn't know the scoring points and was doing match incorrectly for game pieces|

| Ibrahim felt like he understood what was going on and felt confidence improving over the course of the event                                       | Would be good for ibrahim to be able to watch more matches even when being stuck in the [[Pit]], felt like he didn't know the recent stuff happening (twitch?), pit stream is unreliable |
| Seemed to be strategically sound                                                                                                                   | Too many people talking at a time in alliance [[Strategy]]                                                                                                                               |

| Newfound appreciation for how Taegen/Brennan interact with other teams because sometimes they can be difficult, we managed some hard conversations | Had some difficulties getting the right team to [[Match Review]] (awareness)                                                                                                             |


# Pit

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Pit Went Well|Pit things to Improve|
|M: we were efficient at fixing things (like replacing the [[Roborio]] betweeen matches and it working perfectly), still had time to go through checklists|M: would like to have compressed air in the pit (EDITORS NOTE: there's some in the toolbox at all times)|
|K: able to do things we needed to do|Need a new [[battery charger]] ASAP, don't want to have to rely on other teams|
|Even when we had [[judging]] there was times we were working in the background, didn't stop us|K: too many people in the pit at times, makes it harder to work|
|Better about combing through the robot and preventing issues before they happened (rather than retroactive)|Key pieces for replacements were not either super accessible or werent there|
|Most issues that we had were reasonable (no big silly mistakes)|Still packed unneccessary things (E says she can look at packing list), like practice batteries|
|Drive team was in a lot less than Newmarket, more people able to focus on their roles|Getting used to memorizing which tools are used for which repairs - which sizes and using those rather than fishing through allen key box of doom, using the toolbag as much as possible|
|Cleanliness of the pits was good (obviously still room for improvement) but it was good|Speed and hustle, need a can-do attitude and willingness to do whatever needs to be done no matter what (attitude matters!)|
|Kenneth safety all star x2|Should add gloves to the [[packing list]] (because the grease)|
||Improve robot controls knowledge for pit students (still having issues with testing without drive team members), even a map of the operator controller - benjamin tried to explain but M says she needs hands on experience to help memorize what does what|
||make a laminated guide to robot controls|
||Handles on the robot to pick it on and off the field would be helpful (right now you have to reach under the bumpers which can cause damage)|
||impact presentation boards looked good in the pit, just need to improve velcro attachments for them (what about those hooks that attach to walls)|
||get spare [[sprockets]] for [[tensioners]]|

# Overall

- make sure people eat and track whos eaten
- we ended up losing a lot of seats for whatever reason, and then had too much stuff and not enough seats
- investing more in spares (spare tensioners, spare intake) with fast process to switch in out
