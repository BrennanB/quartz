The [[W.A.F.F.L.E.S.]] have built up a reputation since we started as a [[FIRST]] LEGO League Challenge team in 2006. Whenever anyone is at an event as a member or visitor of the W.A.F.F.L.E.S., their actions reflect on the entire team, its members (past and present), and its achievements. Others WILL notice this, and an unfortunate off-hand comment can be remembered for years after you have left the team. If you are wearing team apparel or sitting with the team, you are representing us.

These rules should be followed at all times during an event. As well, the [[General Etiquette & Expectations]] also apply. We have broken this down into general event etiquette for everyone, as well as guidelines and expectations for certain locations at the event.

**A Note on Exceptions**

It is said that there’s an exception to every rule. We have tried to write these rules so that there are *no exceptions* to them. As students grow older, it is more important than ever that they follow these rules so that they can set a good example for younger students. [[Mentor|Mentors]] should follow these without any prompting and should never feel that they are the exception to the rule.

## General Event Etiquette

1. Arrive when directed to by the FRC Lead [[Mentor]] and your sub-team lead mentors.
2. Always check in and out with your sub-team [[mentor]] if you need to leave your station (including for breaks). They are responsible for taking care of you so it is important to know where you are. 
3. Do not make any negative comments about a volunteer, our team, or another team: its robot, its [[Mentor|mentors]], its students, its country or city or origin, or its alliance. Imagine everything you are saying is being written down and will be published with your name next to it. Teams, organizers, and volunteers will hear about negative things said about them.
4. Be aware that when you are wearing team clothing, you are perceived as representing our team. Unless it is your competition role, do not make comments or commitments on behalf of the team. Direct questions to the appropriate person.
5. Be courteous towards others. Do not cut in line or stand in an area that blocks others’ views of the competition. Do hold doors open for others and move out of the way to allow robots through.
6. Follow all venue rules. Do not ask for any exemptions from these rules.
7. Be mindful of your language. Absolutely no swearing, or offensive slang. 
8. Team members should make an effort to mingle when not on duty, as opposed to limiting their interactions to those within their sub-team. For example, the [[Drive Team]] spread out with others for team dinner. 
9. Team members are expected to stay for the duration of the [[Eliminations|elimination]] rounds and [[awards]] ceremony, even if the team is eliminated. This is to show good sportsmanship and respect for our fellow competitors.

## Event Dress Code

*Dress code is strictly enforced on each day of competition.*

1. Team members should wear a [[W.A.F.F.L.E.S.]] team shirt on competition days, including on load-in/practice day.
2. All members of the team must wear their current-year W.A.F.F.L.E.S. team shirt, as the [[sponsor]] logos on the back are updated annually. Family members are encouraged, but not required, to wear a current-year W.A.F.F.L.E.S. shirt.
	- Shirts from previous seasons can be worn at off-season events and on load-in/practice day for official events.
3. All team members must wear black pants, leggings, black jeans (without any rips or washout), or black skirts. Skirts must be paired with leggings.
	- Leggings should be black or W.A.F.F.L.E.S.-themed
4. *[[FIRST]]* Impact Presenters and (Dean’s List nominees if possible) will wear dress appropriately for their interview. This consists of:
	- A White collared shirt,
	- Black blazer,
	- W.A.F.F.L.E.S. tie,
	- Black pants or skirts, and
	- Dress shoes
	*For Dean’s List nominees on the [[Drive Team]], this dress is optional (i.e., they may choose to wear their W.A.F.F.L.E.S. shirt under the black blazer) to avoid changing for their interview.*
5. Closed toed shoes are required at all times. Feel “free” to get a pair with a waffle pattern!
6. When wearing a W.A.F.F.L.E.S. shirt, do not keep a hoodie tied around your waist, wear a sweater, or anything else that covers it. 
	- The [[Drive Team]] buttons, [[Pit Crew]] buttons, the Media Pass badge are exceptions, and team buttons (within reason) are exceptions, provided that they do not obstruct team branding.
	- Badges and buttons should be worn on the opposite side of the “[[W.A.F.F.L.E.S.]]” on the shirt so that our team name is unobstructed. 
	- At World Championships, you must wear your event-provided name badge at all times.

*For cold environments:*
1. A long sleeve black t-shirt under a team shirt or sports sleeves in black are permitted
2. Do not layer your team shirt over a hoodie, as it obstructs the logos on the back
3. For outdoor activities during winter months, coats/jackets are permitted to be worn over our team swag but do your best to show something that indicates you are a part of the team.

*For hot environments:*
1. It is not appropriate to remove your shirt or show your midriff
2. Shorts that end approximately at your fingertips or longer are permitted

## Opening Ceremonies

1. All team members are expected to attend opening ceremonies, unless robot repairs or presentation preparation must be done. 
	- In this case, the pit crew or awards presenters are expected to work quietly so as to not interrupt the ceremonies with loud noises in accordance with event rules.
2. Stand for the national anthem(s) and remove hats, as able.
3. If you are not in the bleacher area and you can hear the national anthem(s), you must stand and remove hats, as able.

## The [[Pit]] Area, Practice Field, & Fieldside

1. The [[pit]] area follows a strict chain of command that must be respected. **All other members must follow the instructions of the Lead Pit Mentors while in the pit.**
	- Members who disagree with the instructions of the Lead [[Pit Mentor]] must still follow their direction. Raise concerns after the fact through an appropriate lead mentor.
	- If members are unable to do this, the Lead Pit Mentor will ask them to stay out of the pit for the remainder of the day or competition.
2. Safety glasses are required at all times. Avoid borrowing a pair of safety glasses from the safety glasses attendants; instead, ask another [[W.A.F.F.L.E.S.]] member to get you a pair from the pit or bring your own.
	- Non-safety rated prescription glasses with side shields are not an appropriate substitute for safety glasses.
3. Space is extremely limited in the team’s **Pit Area (10’x10’)** and on the **Practice Field**. Only the [[Pit]] Crew members should be in the these areas, with the following exceptions:
	- the [[scouting]] or [[strategy]] teams to relay information only
	- the media team to document the team only, with permission of one of the Pit Leads
	- awards students trained in [[talking to judges]], when they have been called in by the Pit Leads
	- [[Drive Team]] or [[Topping Crew]] members, when they have been called in by the [[Pit]] Leads
	Extra [[Mentor|mentors]], students, family members, and guests should remove themselves from the pit when not needed. The pit leads will monitor this and ask people to leave as required (don’t take it personally!).
4. No other members of the team may be **Fieldside** except those who are part of:
	- the [[Drive Team]]
	- the [[pit crew]] as authorised by the Pit Leads during elimination matches
	- [[Strategy]] team as authorised by the Pit Leads or [[Drive Coach]] during elimination matches
	- the media team in designated areas and with the appropriate badge
5. Do not sit in the pit area when there is work to be done or when judges are making their rounds. Members should always be ready to jump in and should maintain a professional appearance.
6. Food and drink are generally not allowed in the pits, except for bottled water, as per venue rules.
7. Do not yell “Robot!” to get people to move out of the way for the robot. Instead, say “excuse me,” politely.
8. When meeting a judge or special guest, greet them confidently with eye contact and introduce yourself. When judges or the media visit the pit, *refer them to a qualified individual or ask them to come back if the respective individuals are unavailable* (we only get one shot to make an excellent impression).

## Sitting in the Stands

1. Good scouting seats are critical to the team’s success (a good view leads to more accurate scouting data, which helps us strategize appropriately and play smart). We require all of the team to help us secure and keep these seats by lining up early for events and taking turns keeping the seats during lunch, etc.
	- The lead scout/scouting mentor will often try to ‘scout out’ the section that we will aim for in advance and communicate this to the scouting team. Our preferred seats are generally mid field, higher up in the stands, near an aisle. Depending on the season/field elements, there may also be a preferred side.
	- The drive team and pit crew will usually be lined up at a separate entrance for the pit.
2. When possible, exit on the aisle with W.A.F.F.L.E.S. team members if you need to get out rather than on the other side where another team is sitting.  
3. Gaming or napping is only permitted only before opening ceremonies have started and during lunch breaks.   
4. All coats and backpacks should be in the stands. If at all possible, DO NOT bring your backpack or coat (weather permitting) into the venue. It quickly becomes hard to navigate in the stands and can be a tripping hazard.  
5. Clean up after yourself (and others) in the stand. At the end of each day, remove any empty water bottles, trash, etc. to make it easier on event staff to clean for the next day.
6. When watching matches, be extra mindful of what you are saying about the teams/robots on the field. You are representing our team and your comments will be heard by others around you!

## Interactions with Volunteers and Staff

- Take some time to thank volunteers. Many volunteers spend dozens or even hundreds of hours working on an event. Recognize volunteers who made the event special for you with a quick thank-you! :)
- Do not talk to referees or judges outside official channels at an event. Even if you know them, you should not make conversation with them during an event.
- Do not ask for special consideration from any volunteer or staff. Follow the rules, and never ask to be exempt from them.
	- The W.A.F.F.L.E.S. mentor team includes a number of people who are senior within the FIRST community. We have people who have been (or currently are) FIRST staff, committee chairs, committee members, etc. *Other teams know this, and it is critical that we not get any special consideration because of it.*

## Awards Ceremony - Other Teams

- Stand (as able) and clap once the team’s number is announced for each award. Continue to stand and clap until the last member has made it through the high-five/wave line. Often, the last person through the line has worked the hardest and deserves recognition.
- Do not speculate on who will win an award based on the award citation. Do not say, “this is us,” for example, or “this is team X.” Others can hear it, and it shows disrespect for the actual winner when such predictions are made.

## Awards Ceremony - Receiving Awards

*Dress code is strictly enforced during the elimination matches as that is when the Awards Ceremony begins.*

- Our team has a tradition of all the mentors lining up to high-five the students as the team goes down to accept their award. After all of the students have passed through the mentor high-five line, the mentors fall in line behind the students for the judges’ high-five line.
	- We recognize that awards received during/between elimination rounds may have team members arriving at different times as opposed to all in one group. Regardless, the team will do our best to prioritise students going through the line first, and then mentors.
	- Mentors will do their best to notify all team members when a round of awards are being handed out so that everyone is aware and can attend.
- Acceptance of awards and award photographs will be restricted to current team members. Others may be invited by lead mentors, such as younger siblings or past mentors.
- Awards are accepted by the entire team. When possible, let others have a chance to hold the trophy or pose for a photo with it. It is important that a blue banner, trophy, and plaque are displayed by the students who specialised in the area of a particular award. A lead mentor will organize who holds awards during team photos to recognize the work of these students. Mentors will not hold these in pictures unless it is a mentor-specific award.
- If medals come with an award, and are not handed out by the judges, then the bag of medals must be transferred to a lead mentor. Only mentors may hand medals to students. Handing medals to students is a recognition of their achievement and success over the past year; in lieu of judges handing them to students, mentors represent the next most appropriate group to honour students’ achievements.
