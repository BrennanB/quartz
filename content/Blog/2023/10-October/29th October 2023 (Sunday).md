# Configurable Common Components

To make CADding assemblies easier, I added some configurable components so we no longer need to switch out whole parts if we want a planetary gearbox with more stages, or a [[Motors|motor]] with/without an adapter board, etc.

To change the configuration of a components, just right click the component and choose a configuration from the dropdown:

Configurable components added so far:
- [[Rev]] MaxPlanetary Gearbox (1-3 stages)
- WCP [[Kraken X60|Kraken]] X60 (With/Without Andersen adapter board)

Upcoming configurable components:
- Button head cap screws (#8-32, \#10-32, 1/4"-20, configurable lengths)
- Socket head cap screws (Same as BHCS)
- Bearings (Hex vs round ID, bore size)
- Gears (From all vendors)
