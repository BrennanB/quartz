Had a call with team 5719 trying to help them out with their assorted robot issues prior to STEMley! Always a good experience to help out other teams and gives us the chance to learn something from other teams systems.

One thought I had was to implement a better systems check any time the robot has gone through transport. Generally we do give the robot a look-over, but journeys in the trailer can always cause some things to come unplugged in ways that others haven't.

Also a good reminder to go over what the lights mean for any assorted [[Motor Controller]] (and honestly, things like the [[Roborio]] and [[PDH]] as well).

Hopefully we got them up and running - looks like some issues with the ribbon cable on the [[NEO Brushless V1.1]] motor that they had been using (which is an annoying but common issue with the first gen of the [[REV]] products). 

Another design choice they had made was an [[Elevator]] with a [[Shifting Gearbox]]. The [[Pneumatics]] had seemingly fired so it was stuck in second gear, which was partially contributing to their elevator issues? Not something I think we would often have a use for, but some 2018 robots used shifting gearboxes on their arm to activate 'climbing mode'.
