# 254 Chief Thread

Lots of handy things coming from 254's [2023 tech binder thread](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/team-254-presents-2023-breakdown-technical-binder-code-q-a/443167)

They used grippy tape for their cube intake. Called [Cattounge tape](https://www.amazon.com/Non-Abrasive-Grip-Tape-CatTongue-Grips/dp/B09JL8S2Q9/ref=asc_df_B09JL8S2Q9/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=564702638799&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=10018644511543140268&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9031923&hvtargid=pla-1622032610358&th=1). 254 claims it's similar to floated neoprene rollers in terms of grip. Probably worth getting some to try it out.

Also it looks like 254 used Rev [magnetic limit switches](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1462/) aka hall effect sensors for their elevator. I like the packaging of these, and think we should look at using them for 2024.
