# 254 Elevator Kickstand

> A nifty little kickstand exists to let the carriage start the match 2/3rd of the way up, for fast initial object placement. A 3D printed piece pivots on a shoulder bolt and is tensioned away from the elevator with some rubber bands. It can pushed against the upright tube as the [[elevator]] carriage bearing is lowered onto it. When the auton starts, the carriage goes up and the rubber bands pull the kickstand out of the way for the rest of the [[match]] to allow all motion.

Seems like a neat way to have the [[elevator]] carriage start at an alternate starting position that isn't the ground if needed. Nice and simple to execute.

Only a week until STEMley! Very exciting, last full day of [[Drive Practice]] today at the [[Kingston Robotics Lab]] to get our [[Driver]] and [[Operator]] synergy up.

> Wiring hall effect sensors directly to a falcon wasn't something I was even aware of. This seems like a nice way to do it, and I assume the kraken is also capable of doing this, but we should check!

Today as the bearer of bad news updating the blog from two days back, the [[Kraken X60|kraken]] appears uncapable of doing this. Sadness. I'll upload a picture explaining why later today when I can figure out how the imgur plugin works.
