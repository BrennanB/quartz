# Configurable Gears

Christmas has come early, Configurable 20DP 1/2" Hex Bore Gears are here! Try them out by downloading changes to your 4476 Parts Library through CacheCAD.

Features:
- Super easy to swap between gears of different materials and sizes
- Includes all aluminum and steel gears from WCP and REV Canada, pocketed where possible
- Configurations listed in BOM
- Mating faces and circle stay constant (mates won't break)
- Consistent and nice appearances

But of course, it'd be too good to be true if I just came up with a configurable gear system overnight to completely replace our old system. Some of the problems I'm facing are:
- Takes a ton of time to load and rebuild
- A lot of configurations to scroll through, possibly overwhelming for beginner CADders
- Bigger assembly file size
- And we haven't even added 3/8" Hex Bore and Spline Bores yet!

Most of these problems are fixable with tradeoffs (e.g. having aluminum and steel gears as separate configurable files would speed up rebuilds but make it harder to do direct CAD replacements), I'm very open to ideas on how to make this better!
