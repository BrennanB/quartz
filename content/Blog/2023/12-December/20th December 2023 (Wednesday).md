# Manufacturing Methods

After evaluating the manufacturing methods that are available to us, the technical leads have narrowed our useful resources to the following:

- Lexan - Our CNC Router (Omio)
- 1/4" Aluminum - Our CNC Router (Omio)
- < 1/4" Aluminum - Pure Ingenuity (they will probably continue sponsoring our team, can also do bending)
- Non-Crucial Shafts - Our Bandsaws
- Standoffs - BGC's Lathe (not operated by us)
- 3D Printed Parts (Normal) - Various Remote Printers (to be counted)
- 3D Printed Parts (High Strength) - BGC's Markforged
- Tubing - Depends... (Our CNC Router (Omio) / BGC's CNC Router (Omio) / BGC's CNC Router (4x4) / BGC's Manual Mill / BGC's CNC Mill)
- Steel Parts - Fab-Cut

**Resources that have not been assigned a specific use yet:**

Street Health:

BGC:

# Mentors' Areas of Focus

It has also been decided (according to the season timeline) that:

- Eden and Brandon will be focusing mostly during the CAD weeks (1-2)
- Quinton and Taegen during the manufacturing weeks (3-4)
- Brennan during the programming weeks (5-6)
- Other mentors are more than welcome to come in and help whenever
- Technical leads will be having daily recap meetings to update everyone on progress and next steps
