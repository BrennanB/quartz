Day 6
# Shooter Prototyping

## Sandwich Shooter

Generally very inaccurate, but got good range because of wheels on either side!

## Quarter Circle 

Quarter circle had very reliable shots, probably the most reliable we have seen so far.

## Deciding on a Launcher

Having seen a bunch of prototypes, we narrowed it down to dual side roller launcher, so we can control the amount of spin. Still not certain on compression or number of wheels on each side.

## Inside/Outside Intake

After the meeting when reviewing some of the awesome open alliance teams, team 95 the Grasshoppers had a great idea for having an under the bumper intake that could be basically full width intake.

As you can see from the images courtesy of team 95 and their cad, there is another frame member outside the normal swerve frame. This allows a permanent full width intake on the front of the robot to be under the bumper. We discussed this as a team and it was pretty much a no brainer to implement this in our design. It addresses our main concern of the under the bumper intakes width, but then has much better resistance to damage, as well as being a bit simpler to not have to deploy the intake.
