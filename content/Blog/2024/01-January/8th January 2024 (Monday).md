Day 3

# Conveyor

Something else worth considering, was thinking about something similar to 2022 citrus, and having the ability for a [[ground pickup]] to go to different sections based on how things spin. Purple could go to [[shooter]], red could go to amp/trap [[mechanism]]. Requires 2 motors and a bit of fancy power transfer I think. Link the two orange circle wheels, and blue circle wheel on a different [[Motors|motor]].

# Intake [[Prototyping]]

Today we spent some time testing different intake rollers, as well as a two roller system which seems to pick up the note much better than a single roller.

There were some concerns to getting our hockey shot, which is possible with a shallow angle of exit, but may have issues with using the outtake as that.

# 971 Archetype

Looking at a potential 971 2016 style archetype for scoring amp and trap and not needing a second mechanism.

# [[Elevator]] Archetype

Designed possible intake geometry for the archetype.

# [[FTC]] Archetype

We also further developed geometry for the FTC Archetype.

# Team 95 Shooter

Team 95 as part of Open Alliance put out their shooter prototype which is interesting as it has a top and bottom roller, but still generates spin by having a larger OD wheel on one side of the shooter. We still aren't sure how much spin helps with accuracy, or really what kind of compression we need for shooters yet.

# Team 4481 No slide Chain Hooks

Another thing that we were considering early on is making it so our climber doesn't slide on the chain. These options from 4481 both seem viable to minimize/remove that chance.

# XRC Learnings

It seems like side shots on the speaker are a bit more challenging than front shots. Coordinating 3 robots all on the speaker with defense will be a challenge as well. [[Endgame]] [[fouls]] are dangerous and can be drawn fairly easily. Two tech fouls = 10 points is a massive amount of point swing.

Lets get Kraken.

Hopefully we get ours soon.
