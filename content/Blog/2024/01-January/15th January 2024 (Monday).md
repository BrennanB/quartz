Day 10

# Shooter Prototyping

After maxing out the speed of the shooter, we found that 5.5" of compression was ideal as it gave us the most range and with good consistency.

# CAD Progress

Students got started on the structure of the elevator, the intake side plate, the shooter assembly, and kicker hooks to hold onto the underside of the stage.

We will continue to work on finishing the structure of the elevator, revising the geometry of the intake side plate, flushing out the kicker, and adjusting the geometry of the shooter to match our prototype findings.
