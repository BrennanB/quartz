# Trap Shooting

Some teams have been seeing some success with shooting from the floor into the trap. We had initially ruled this out as possible due to the flap that has to move out of the way for a note to go into the trap.

111 Also tried but couldn't find the right angles. We had a big discussion about if we still wanted to continue with the complexity of a dedicated trap mechanism/motion while climbing. For now our plan is to plan to dunk into the trap, but will evaluate if we can shoot once the robot is made.

# Scouting Brainstorming

Did some brainstorming about what kind of ui/data we might want for scouting this year.

**Auto**  

- Should have: track number of amp and speaker shots
- Don’t need: move (will be on blue alliance), climb and trap scoring (very unlikely)

**Teleop**  

- Should have: track amp, speaker, and amplified speaker shots
- Don’t need: climb and trap scoring (will be in endgame), coopertition (pretty sure will be on blue alliance)

**Endgame**  

- Should have: trap scoring and high note scoring (we are not sure if blue alliance will have these)
- Don’t need: climb and harmony bonus during climb (blue alliance will probably have these)

Robot is starting to take shape. Elevator mounting is being figured out, and intake is close to completion. We are aiming to get parts sent out by the end of the weekend.

# Competitive Concept (WCP)

[WCP Competitive Concept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKs_UDj4Ej0) released today, and looks pretty good. Shows a good pace for the game, and shooting on the move which we probably will want to do!
