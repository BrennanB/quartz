Day 7

# Blocky CAD/Geometry

Looked a lot at geometry for the trap, it's proving to be quite a challenge! Our current plan is to have linear telescopes, however the challenge is the chain while climbing will need to be pulled quite far down, basically to the bumpers.

# Vision

We set up a simple pair of april tags for testing for vision alignment to the speaker for our further shots. While it's not a high priority right now it's nice to have ready for testing generally when we have the time for it.

# Prototypes

## Intake

Intake cad was worked on so that we can cut a version of the inside outside intake we decided on yesterday. Still needs to be reviewed tomorrow morning.

## Shooter

We also have a two parted shooter prototype prepared for testing. Since we decided on side wheels for launching yesterday, we still need to test compression and we also want to test 1 wheel per side or 2 wheels per side. One of our theories is generally the more contact time a shooter has the more accurate it tends to be.
