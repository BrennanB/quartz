Day 9
# Intake Prototyping

Changes were made to the high fidelity intake made the day prior. The churros going across the width of the intake were removed, and flatbelt was added between the two back rollers. The flatbelt guides notes up the intake path really nicely, the last major area for improvement was intaking from the side.

# Shooter Prototyping

After finding a way to power both shooter motors, we got the prototype running:

Not much was done to test the actual range and consistency of the shooter though, so that will happen another day.
# Shooter CAD

More work was done to define the main geometry of the shooter, measurements are flexible so we can easily tweak things based on findings from testing.
