# What is it?

The World Championship is the culminating event for the season of FRC. 

There are several ways that teams qualify for the event:
- By winning District Championships (such as [[Ontario District Championship (DCMP)]]) or [[Regional Events]]
- Qualifying via [[District Points]]
- By winning the [[Impact Award]] at a District Championships or Regional Event
- By winning the [[Engineering Inspiration]] Award at District Championships or Regional Event
- By winning the previous year's World Championship
- By earning a slot on the [[Priority Waitlist]]
  
Typically the World championship has eight [[Divisions]] of play, featuring eight [[Official Fields]] for teams to compete on. The winners of all 8 divisions will then play an additional [[Double Elimination]] bracket to crown the World Champion. The final bracket is played on the coveted [[Einstein Field]]. The winning alliance will get reinvited to the following year's championship.
