All robots are required to have bumpers for safety, to indicate their alliance colour, and to indicate their team number.  These are made out of pool noodles with a plywood backing.  Teams can either have a red set and a blue set, or they can have reversible bumpers.  Our team has a reversible bumper design that involves a flap that can be flipped to the red or blue side, and secured with velcro.
