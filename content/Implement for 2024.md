# General

- New recruitment video
- Increasing positive reinforcement
- More social activities, especially in the off-season ([[Season Timeline]])
	- Game nights, escape rooms, dinners, etc.

# [[Pit]] Area

- Talked about [[Pit]] food - having pit snacks?
- Stocking [[Tools]]
- [[Colour Coding]] [[Tools]]
- New toolbox on robot cart

# [[Scouting]]

- Putting data online for ease of access
- Revamping [[Data Validation]]
	- Each stat for each team has an associated error
	- [[Pit Scouting]] to generate flags for each team
	- Use flags to compare to inputted data to see if data matches flagged ability (ex. team scores high cone, but flags say they can't)
- Personal [[Pick List]] online
	- Automatically merge into one [[pick list]] for [[Scouting Meeting]]
- Convert all features from current Excel sheet to online
- New scouting tablets (from summer camp)

# [[Strategy]]

- [[Slack]] threads for every quals [[match]] and [[Eliminations|elims]] alliances.


# [[Drive Team]]

- Record matches from behind the glass
## Reducing Stress Levels

1. Doing something fun completely unrelated to robots to disrupt potentially negative thinking
2. Better structure around focusing one [[match]] at a time. It's fine to briefly think about the future, but the now is always more important.
# [[Design]]

- Part and [[Assembly]] [[Drawings]]
- Port over from other document

# [[Electrical]]

- [ ] Investigate [[Hall Effect Sensors|hall effect sensor]] wiring with the [[Kraken X60|kraken]]

technical leads meeting notes oct 28 2023

BGC location meeting days - there will be two days during build season which are "quiet days" - no equipment use/field

don't see the need to use the BGC space until we're in the semi-functional space, practicing, etc

what do we want to use the space for? 
- practicing
- tuning autos
- using the big tools (has to be done with an 'expert mentor' for supervision, which we should decide who those will be in advance of build season to get them properly trained)
- using the 3d printers
- using the computers on an as-need basis
- using the "classroom" space to program or have other students working on things like awards handouts to break into smaller groups

what is our scheduling plan? where are we going to be, when?
- Early season at SH when formulating robot ideas/concepts

where do we want to assemble robot?
- more space to do majority of it at SH, if we need to do some manufacturing we can bring over material and do it there
- this includes wiring
- should work on a better system for spray painting but still do at SH

when the robot is assembled?
- initial programming can be done at SH
- move when the robot is testable and theoretically works
- maybe look at using the family day weekend as a milestone for the move to BGC - leave out of SH and return and move in to BGC?

we can't meet at BGC? what do
- goal is to leave the robot there
- meetings at SH
	- iterations/cad focus, manufacturing, and award focus
- drive team takes days off ideally

are we going to build field elements at SH?
- just enough to prototype until the robot is working
- things that are feasible and needed

are we still going to family day weekend?
- plan for it
- tell (force? threaten?) good teams to come to us and pray for the best

in season meeting times:
At least one of us should be at a meeting, likely will end up 2 

weeknights from 18:30-21:30
weekends from ??? to ???

Q has alternating labs on monday/tuesday nights
Brandon possibly unavailable weekend nights
Brennan has preference to weekends
generally makes sense for taegen/brennan to go in at same times
Eden and taegen avail TBD

overall:
Eden/brandon are early on
quinton/taegen are during assembly/wiring/getting robot ready to go
Brennan is more of a mid-end of season dude

weekend possibly 10-7, with shifts from 10-3 and 2-7
when we can't do sunday mornings at BGC we can just run a BGC shift from 2-7 and the morning dudes can be at SH
