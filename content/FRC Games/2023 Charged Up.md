# Game Overview

## Successful Robot Archetypes

There was a large variety of successful robot archetypes. Stationary tilted elevators, variety of multi joint arms, tilting elevators, horizontal and vertical [[elevator]] combos. All types of robot archetypes were viable at the highest level, and teams executed a variety of robots very well.
## High Level Strategic Overview

2023 for most of the season was a 3 offensive robot game. Generally this was due to the limited effectiveness of defense with how many protected zones there were. Generally teams would place cubes in the hybrid nodes as they were a bit easier to work with. Triple balances in [[endgame]] were basically required in [[Eliminations|playoffs]].

## Game Piece Placements

High nodes had to be prioritized first as they were the most points, however until worlds generally it would be the hybrid or lowest nodes that were second priority. Generally hybrid nodes were much easier to score on than the mid nodes, and they were only one point less per game piece which made them attractive especially for completing links.

Later on in the season, launching game pieces and then pushing them into nodes later was favored to take quick cycles and increase overall game piece throughput.

A big part of competent alliances was keeping track of near completed links and ensuring that they get completed prior to the end of the match. Often times alliances would struggle to track this and would have earned a large amount of points if completing links instead of arbitrarily placing a couple pieces.
