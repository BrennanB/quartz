Competitions are a large part of what we do at W.A.F.F.L.E.S.! Unlike in-season, where our goal is to help you learn whatever aspect of the team you are interested in, at an event the team arrives with defined roles to help improve clarity and overall performance. This section outlines the different roles that the team uses.
