## Driver Overview

The robot driver is one of five #driveteam  members who are field-side during the teams matches. As the name suggests, they are responsible for driving the robot during a match.

Like the other drive team members, it is expected that the driver attends all team competitions, as well as the #PracticeFieldTrip that happens during the final weeks of build season (generally in Hamilton or Toronto.)
