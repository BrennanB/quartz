# Communication

We have several expectations and goals for any drive team communication. These goals are designed around having the most efficient possible actions as a whole unit as a drive team.
## Following Chain of Command

We operate during the match through a strict chain of command for any actions during the match. The order of priority is as follows:

1. [[Drive Coach]]
2. [[Driver]]
3. [[Operator]]
4. [[Human Player]]

The [[Technician]] is not permitted by the [[FIRST]] [[Official Rulebook]] to communicate with other drive team members during the match.

We follow this chain of command to ensure as quick of a response time to react to changes in the match plan as rapidly as possible. If a direction is given by someone higher up in the chain, those lower are expected to immediately follow that direction without question. After the match discussion can follow about in match decisions, or if a question is asked during a match feedback can be given.

The [[Drive Coach]] is responsible for the major strategic decisions because all other members on the drive team have robot specific tasks to complete. This frees them up to interact with partner teams and observe the whole field in detail to make the most informed next steps for our execution of [[Strategy]].

## Suggested Actions

It's important for all drive team members to be able to suggest things during a match if they think of some [[Strategy|strategy]] adaptations that may need to be made. Bringing these up the chain of command is important during the match to make sure they are aware of things.

> [!question] Remember!
> Remember that the Chain of Command still applies, this is just for suggestions to increase communication. If a command is given it's expected for that to be immediately followed.
## Purposeful Language

The [[Drive Team]] discusses and creates terms to indicate locations on the field to allow for smooth communication. We always use the same terms to make comprehension of actions easier to follow through on. We also try to keep communication as brief as possible to get the point across as quickly as possible.

# We Do Our Best

Our goal for each match is to execute the agreed upon strategy to the best of our abilities.

# We are Team Players

Our primary focus on any alliance is to be team players and do our best to contribute to helping with the alliance's goals. Our job is not to showcase our skills at the expense of the alliance.

# We act with Integrity

We play the game as honestly as possible. When we go to argue our case we do so honestly, and do not try to bend the truth to overturn a call. If a call is made in error that benefits us, we advocate for it's reversal to maintain an even playing field for all teams at the competition.

> Remember that we are ambassadors for the team, and acting poorly can reflect the team for years to come.
# Strategy Team Does the Strategy

We have our [[Strategy]] team come up with match plans and advocate for our matches with our alliance partners. After a plan is agreed on, the [[Drive Team]] is informed and gives the final okay to the strat. We do this to minimize workload on drive team members and allow them to not worry too much about winning matches.

# Immediate Review of Matches

We record matches on a tablet for immediate review with the [[Drive Team]] after a match. [[Strategy Team]] will lead the discussion in reviewing the match to see what could be done better. It's important to review matches as soon as possible while things are fresh in our minds, and we can absorb changes to help us perform better.
