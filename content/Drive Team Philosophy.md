# Communication

We have several expectations and goals for any drive team communication. These goals are designed around having the most efficient possible actions as a whole unit as a drive team.
## Following Chain of Command

We operate during the match through a strict chain of command for any actions during the match. The order of priority is as follows:

1. [[Drive Coach]]
2. [[Driver]]
3. [[Operator]]
4. [[Human Player]]

The technician is not permitted by the [[FIRST]] [[Official Rulebook]] to communicate with other drive team members during the match.

We follow this chain of command to ensure as quick of a response time to react to changes in the match plan as rapidly as possible. If a direction is given by someone higher up in the chain, those lower are expected to immediately follow that direction without question. After the match discussion can follow about in match decisions, or if a question is asked during a match feedback can be given.

The [[Drive Coach]] is responsible for the major strategic decisions because all other members on the drive team have robot specific tasks to complete. This frees them up to interact with partner teams and observe the whole field in detail to make the most informed next steps for our execution of [[Strategy]].


# We Do Our Best

Our goal for each match is to execute the agreed upon strategy to the best of our abilities

# We are Team Players

Our primary focus on any alliance is to be team players and do our best to contribute to helping with the alliance's goals. Our job is not to showcase our skills at the expense of the alliance.
