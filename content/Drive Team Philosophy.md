# Following Chain of Command
We operate during the match through a strict chain of command for any actions during the match. The order of priority is as follows:

1. [[Drive Coach]]
2. [[Driver]]
3. [[Operator]]
4. [[Human Player]]

The technician is not permitted by the [[FIRST]]  [[Official Rulebook]] to communicate with other drive team members during the match.

We follow this chain of command to ensure as quick of a response time to react to changes in the match plan as rapidly as possible. If a direction is given by someone higher up in the chain, those lower are expected to immediately follow that direction without question. After the match discussion can follow about in match decisions, or if a question is asked during a match feedback can be given.
