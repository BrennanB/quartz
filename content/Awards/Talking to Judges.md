**General Etiquette**

* Be friendly, smiley, and engaged
* Speak clearly
* Pay attention to the judges and engage unless your task is urgent
* It’s okay to tell the judges to come back at another time if we are very busy
    * Ie. Just about to go to a match, getting inspected, the robot just had a massive thing go wrong, etc.
    * Eg. “We would love to tell you more about _____, but unfortunately we have to go to a match right now.  Would you be able to come by our pit later at x time?”
* If you don’t have the most expertise in an area, hold a basic conversation about it until others arrive
    * A mentor will be in the pit and will call the appropriate people to talk to the judges
* Mentors don’t talk to the judges, just the students

**Answering Questions**

* Put an emphasis on ITERATION, GROWTH in an area, and the PROCESS of things
    * We don’t need to present ourselves as having got it right from the start--talk about how we got to the successful point we are at now
    * Talk about [[Prototyping]] and other (relevant) things that we tried that didn’t work, and what we LEARNED from them
    * Talk about what we have changed (will differ from event to event)
    * Talk about the CHALLENGES we encountered and how we OVERCAME them
* Have specific points you want to get in and GUIDE the conversation to hit as many of those as possible
* Phrase things positively
* Include the team member(s) with the most experience/knowledge in the area of discussion
    * Eg. “Logan was the lead designer for our climber, so he can talk to you more about his design process”
