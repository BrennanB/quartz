# Robot Awards

## Autonomous Award

Celebrates the team that has demonstrated consistent, reliable, high-performance robot operation during autonomously managed actions. Evaluation is based on the robot’s ability to sense its surroundings, position itself or onboard mechanisms appropriately, and execute tasks.

## Creativity Award

Celebrates creativity that enhances strategy of play and was intentionally designed and not discovered.

#### Guidelines

- A team must be able to competently describe the creative/unique feature(s) and can trace its conception and design.
- Since creativity may involve risk of failure, the team should be able to describe how they mitigated that risk.
- The creative element’s uniqueness has a practical application and contributes to the objectives of the competition.
- Developing the creative element contributed to the team’s success on the field.
## Excellence in Engineering Award

Celebrates the team that demonstrates a professional approach to the design process

#### Guidelines

- A team must be able to describe the engineering process they went through and can trace elements of the designs from conception.
- The designs reflect an engineering solution to a specific problem, and it is functional and practical.
- The designs are elegant and advantageous on the field of play.

## Industrial Design Award

Celebrates the team that demonstrates industrial design principles, striking a balance between form, function, and aesthetics. 

#### Guidelines

- A team must be able to describe how their robot is elegant, efficient (simple/executable), and practical.
- The entire machine [[Design]], or the detailed process used to develop the design, is worthy of this recognition, and not just a single component.
- The robot distinguishes itself from others by its aesthetic and functional design.

## Innovation in Control Award

Celebrates an innovative control system or application of control components – [[Electrical]], mechanical or [[Software]] – to provide unique machine functions.

#### Guidelines

- A team must be able to identify and describe the controls innovation and can trace its conception, design, manufacturing/assembly, or deployment.
- The control system is innovative and unique. It is integrated with the machine, human players, strategy, etc. in concept and execution.
- The innovation is practical; it addresses the game’s challenge and is reliable under the stress of competition.

## Quality Award

Celebrates machine robustness in concept and fabrication

#### Guidelines

- A team must be able to describe their quality plan i.e. how their design ensures robustness throughout the entire competition.
- The entire machine demonstrates quality: workmanship, welds, attachment systems, wiring, paint, etc.
- The machine can withstand the rigors of competition – maintaining functionality, including the use of designed-in redundancy and risk mitigation measures.
- Building the machine contributes to the team’s success.

# Individual Awards

## Woodie Flowers Award

This award recognizes an individual who has done an outstanding job of motivation through communication while also challenging the students to be clear and succinct in their communications. As such, it is very important that this be a student-led effort and a student decision. One student will act as the nominator. Lead mentors should direct 1 or 2 students to the online entry site and let the high school students decide whom to nominate. Adults can help edit and should check the essay and the submission information for accuracy, but this must be a student-led effort. The author(s) of the 3,000-character (max.) essay must be clearly identified as high school students in the online submission.
