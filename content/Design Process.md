steps of the [[frc]] [[design]] process


## Phase 1 - Prototyping:


## Phase 2: Design Concept

- Simplicity (num of motors, combining parts, degrees of freedom, foolproofing the assembly, etc.)
- Manufacturing feasibility/process (designing within our manufacturing means)
- Geometry (pathing, dead spots)
- Packaging
	- Max extension
	- Maximum height
	- Frame perimeter
- Layout of mechanisms
- Checking calculations
	- Motor math
	- C-C distances, pathing and accessible tensioning
- Power budget (num of motors running at once, num of slots being used)
- Electrical integration
	- Sensors
	- Wire routing
	- Space for electrical components
- COG/tippiness
- General maintenance (eg. avoid needing to take a lot of the robot apart to do a replacement)
## Phase 3: Design Details
- Fasteners
- Hole sizes
- Clearances
- Maintenance (hand access, tool access, modularity, etc.)
	- Longevity?
	- Supports/cross members and weak spots (thickness/snapping, orientation of cheese holes, etc.)
- Mechanical
- Look at switching to REV MAXplanetary
- Give swerve motors back to Leia for defense in drive practice
- Manufacturing and Assembly
	- Part drawings for parts that are manually machined
	- Assembly drawings, yay!
	- Map out or cad spacers
		- Maybe print custom length spacers?  Would reduce modularity but would make assembly more foolproof
	- Spreadsheet tracking for parts needing to be manufacturing
	- Have a BOM as we go
	- New tools (allen keys, ratcheting wrenches)
		- Organized!!!!!!!!! Placed strategically
	- Make full spare systems (e.g. intake)
	- Teach more students how to CNC
	- Do CAM online and remotely
- Manufacture in assembly order
- Design leads determine assembly order in a master spreadsheet
- Purchasing
	- Have more people involved
	- Subteam leads responsible for their own tabs in spreadsheet
	- Have list of people who are willing to put things on credit cards
	- Diligent about part numbers and quantities
	- Order before the season starts
		- Metal, lexan
		- Rivets
		- Washers
		- Bolts (look at grades, can ask Andy)
		- REV MAXplanetary
		- More yellow organizers
		- 3D printer?
- Electrical
	- Label everything
	- Have a student who knows electrical systems be involved in design
- Categorize
	- Must never fail (chassis, superstructure)
	- Shouldnâ€™t fail, but can be replaced easily if it does
