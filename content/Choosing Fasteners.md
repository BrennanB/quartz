# Bolts

Usually use sizes 8-32, 10-32, and ¼-20 depending on the application
Usually use hex key socket heads since they do not strip as easily as others
Use countersunk/flat heads or button heads if there isn’t clearance (space) to have the socket head
They are stronger and longer lasting than rivets, but they also add up to a lot of weight.  If a mechanism needs to be particularly strong or is expected to take a lot of force (eg. an intake that extends past the bumpers and is prone to hitting against the wall), bolts might be a good choice
A chart with hole sizes for regular and tapped (threaded) is available here.  Reference it to ensure you make the holes the correct size (usually use close fit).
We use bolts with…
Nylock nuts, which have a plastic rim to prevent it from loosening as easily as regular nuts
Rivnuts, which can be fit into regular holes when the other side of the bolt is inaccessible
When designing, you need to make sure there is room to fit the appropriate tools to allow for proper maintenance.
An allen key (or screwdriver), as well as a wrench (or rivnutter)

# Rivets

Usually use 3/16” or occasionally ¼” diameter rivets
Can be aluminum or steel depending on the application
Are lightweight and easy to replace, but can quickly loosen or shear off if they take a lot of force in a weak direction
