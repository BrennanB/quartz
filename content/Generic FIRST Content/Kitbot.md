The kitbot is a base drivetrain that is given in the [[Kit of Parts]] that gets teams to a base level of competitiveness with their drivetrain. Currently the standard is a [[6 Wheel Drop Center]], but the current kitbot can be modified to 4 wheel drives, or [[Mechanum Drive]]

Since 2024 the kitbot has also included parts and designs to compete in the game at a very base level.
