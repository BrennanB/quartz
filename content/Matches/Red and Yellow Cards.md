Just like soccer there are Red and Yellow cards given to Robots or [[Alliance]] s during the match. These can be for various different reasons. 

During Matches
Yellow stays with robot until end of matches
Red will give a 0 [[Ranking Points]] to the offending robot and leave a yellow with the robot for remaining matches
Earning 2 yellows will result in a red card

During [[Elimination]]s
Yellow stays with [[Alliance]] until event is over
Red will give a 0 score to alliance and leave a yellow for remainder of event
Earning 2 yellows will result in a red card
