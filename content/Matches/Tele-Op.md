After [[Autonomous]], there is a [[Driver]] controlled period. This last 2:15 with the final 30s being [[Endgame]]. Tele-Op stands for Tele-Operation. After the train whistle(i think-Q), the driver and/or operator can step before the white line and grab the controller to begin operating the robot. 

The Tele-Op period is the largest portion of the game and the majority of scoring occurs during this period.
