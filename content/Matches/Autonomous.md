# What is it?

Autonomous is the first 15 seconds of the game where robots are preprogrammed to complete instructions. FRC previously had  10 second autonomous modes, as well as no autonomous modes at all!

Every competition has a different Autonomous that can earn a team more points. Generally they are similar challenges to the [[Tele-Op]] period but are worth more points. Many years have a drive or park bonus that is a very easy Autonomous movement for all teams to participate.

When strategizing with different teams, it is important to remember that the robot must act fully on its own. Generally a team will either create multiple different files for Autonomous modes beginning in different zones. Or a more complex way is to have a switch board that allows you to chose different parts to the mode such as: Park, Shoot, Place Right, Place Left, etc.
