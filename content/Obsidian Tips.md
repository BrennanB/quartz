# Goals for the Site

The goal for this site is to have a fully comprehensive, searchable resource for all things [[W.A.F.F.L.E.S.]] so that we can improve our skills year over year. The whole website is not designed to be a guide for all teams, but a guide for our team and how we do things that other teams can read and take inspiration from for what they think can fit with their systems if they want.

Stuff that's hosted on the site:

- [[Design]] guidelines, how to actually design
- [[Manufacturing]] methods and the [[Tools]] we use. When you might use some of those tools
- [[Electrical]] references for how-tos and referencing schematics
- [[Solidworks]] guides on getting set up and following our team's practices.
- [[Event & Season Reviews]] for reflecting on what we did well/need to improve on.
- #blog like notes documenting our team's process, thoughts, for later review and learning what worked and what didn't.
- [[Competition Roles]] documentation, as well as how we actually execute each role, what we care about
- [[Previous 4476 Robots]] and learnings from old robots that are easily referenceable so we can learn from past mistakes and successes
- [[FRC Season Reviews]] for detailed looks at an [[FRC]] season as a whole, what strategies, robots, and mechanisms were dominant and why.

## Tags for general concepts

- CAD
- Design
- Strategy
- Solidworks
## Pages/notes for physical things we may want info on

- Roborio
- PDH
- Cim motor
- Solidworks

## Mix of both

CAD will have its own page describing what it is, but notes will have tags for those concepts broadly, as we wont link to the CAD page on every single note.
