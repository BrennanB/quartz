# New notes/pages vs tags

## Tags for general concepts

- CAD
- Design
- Strategy
## Pages/notes for physical things we may want info on

- Roborio
- PDH
- Cim motor

## Mix of both

CAD will have its own page describing what it is, but notes will have tags for those concepts broadly, as we wont link to the CAD page on every single note.
