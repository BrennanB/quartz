# Why Strategize?

How you plan around playing the game is probably the single most influential way to rapidly increase your performance in a match or at an event. Strategic design allows you to set objectives for your robot to complete that are most beneficial to doing well in an FRC game.

## Designing Around Getting Bonus RPs

Usually having the ability to guarantee ranking points is a good thing, though sometimes it can be detrimental to your overall performance to spread out your resources trying to do too many things. Many top robots have ignored capabilities to get ranking points to focus on doing a specific aspect of the game really well. Teams like 2910 and 973 in [[2019 Destination Deep Space]] ignoring some levels of the rocket ship scoring, or 2056 in [[2024 Crescendo]] avoiding Trap scoring.

# Match Planning

## Playing for the Win vs Playing for the Bonus RP

There are times where you will have to decide between playing to try to win, or forgoing trying to "win" the match and try to secure available RP.
