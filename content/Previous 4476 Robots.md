Every year since 2014, we have named our robot after a different person in need of a stem cell transplant.  We share their stories at events to spread awareness and encourage people aged 17-35 to do a cheek swab and [join the registry](https://www.blood.ca/en/stemcells?utm_campaign=onematch&utm_medium=redirect&utm_source=onematch) to help find life-saving matches.
