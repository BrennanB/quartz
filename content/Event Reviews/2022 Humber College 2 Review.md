# Scouting/Strategy

## Things we did well/would do again:

-   The seats in the stands were great

-   Helpful having a scout that could also act as scouting lead (added flexibility)

-   Scouting timeline was decent because of fewer matches

-   Was taking a reasonable/manageable amount of data, easy to explain

-   Tablets/electronic devices was good at streamlining process

-   Battery on tablets seemed good, battery pack was super helpful as well

## Things we want to change/do better:

-   Review what makes a good comment in training

-   More thorough training, prioritized higher

-   Try to get app on iOS devices, test running database on a mac laptop

-   Dedicated device for match recording

-   Make sure all things are downloaded and prepped in advance

-   Trying to get scouts more involved in strategic side/making the picklist

-   Get strategists earlier access to data

-   Look into combatting device limitation (finding/replacing the lost tablet, making sure we have enough devices in advance)

-   Create a device for charging in stands (Jackery/robot battery charger)

-   Practice making picklists

-   Not pick teams that haven't checked their falcon motors for loctite (desperate times called for desperate measures)

## Training

-   Rescout, check data quality, make practice pick list

-   What do we plan to do to win/play our best?  Have scouts sit in on strat team convo

-   Go over types of comments that were most helpful/less helpful (from strat team perspective)

## Scouting App

-   Display match num on QR code screen (so we can match saved QR code to match)

-   Save QR Code screenshot onto device automatically

-   Tier list button top left while scouting

-   Make sure assets load on app faster (plus, minus, comment)

-   Easy way to switch between matches

-   Upper hub on top and lower hub on bottom

-   Red/blue alliance stations 1,2,3 numbering reversed positions for Red vs Blue (nice to have)

-   Working on Apple devices (don't worry about this for now)

## Server app

-   Fix validation - check col references first

-   Pull Data automatically - doesn't break if not connected to internet ideally

-   Extra column added in pull data script - remove (nice to have)

-   Allow scanning incomplete sets of match data

-   Maybe append all matches/pulled data directly to database

-   WiFi solution (tethering) device - Kaley

## Scouting database

-   Add comments to team lookup sheet

## Picklist

-   ?

# Robot

Things we did well/would do again:

-   Safety pins on the climber with the bright tape

-   Traversal climbing was super exciting

-   Electrical was well done

-   Swerve!

-   Auto pathing was very consistent

-   Intake

Things we want to change/do better:

-   No making code changes without testing first

-   Add a hardstop for the hood so that our fender shot is guaranteed even if hood is broken

-   Replace the linear servos/redesign the hood

-   Replace the pulley between between the compliant and mecanum rollers to not be 3d (metal/crowned)

-   Test cheeseholing in damage prone locations (potentially change climber)

-   Improve climber hooks/check evenness of extension/climber stuckage

-   Add grip to the hooks, including rotating hooks

-   Figure out why the popcorning happened (maybe due to slowing of conveyor in comparison to speed of intake? Also consider tighter rope)

-   Add lengths to falcon gearbox shafts to avoid enable-required

-   Possibly change climber ratio

-   Automate climb process (add sensors? gyro? sequence?)

-   5 ball

-   Plz use limelight, improve mount, tune

-   Switch to angle of elevation instead of screen area

-   Adding a wide angle camera for vision of the carpet?

-   L I G H T S (when shooter is at speed, balls in robot, etc)

# Pit Crew

## Things we did well/would do again:

-   You worked very hard, we didn't repeat mistakes

-   Good sense of urgency

-   Good job calling CSA/experienced people when we were out of our depth

## Things we want to change/do better:

-   Do the pre-match checklist as much as possible (code stuff often didn't get done due to time/debugging issues)

-   Walk and work, the schedule is so brutal so we can do some while on the move if possible

# Drive Team

## Things we did well/would do again:

-   Lots of thinking on your feet and building communication quickly

-   Ibrahim shoots, he scores!

-   Really good job at question boxing, good to have number on hand

## Things we want to change/do better:

-   Make sure driver station is setup properly

-   Continue building driver/operator communication

-   Figure out how to coach more efficiently

-   Human player give ball count?

-   Drive team specific rules - almost stepped over the wall, auto line

# Watch Party/Zoom

## Things we did well/would do again:

-   Having one to get people involved! Loved having alumni back and chatting with parents

-   Was helpful for getting the remote people in

## Things we want to change/do better:

-   Gets overwhelming with a lot of people in your ear for strategy

-   Better list of people 

-   Possibly different call for strategy, eliminate the waiting room, optimizing call

# Awards

## Things we did well/would do again:

-   Our presenters are great people

## Things we want to change/do better:

-   Do more work in the offseason

-   More practice

-   Take our deadlines seriously - potentially adapting a priority list structure

-   More mentors/support for working on awards

# Logistics

## Things we did well/would do again:

-   Food was amazing, thanks sarah <3

-   Someone separate and organize drinks?

## Things we want to change/do better:

-   Bring waffles stress relief bag to the pits

-   Mentors to do active stress checks on the students we are working with

-   Stress partners? More transparency on what people need when stress

-   Make sure people are hydrated

# Parent Information

## Things we did well/would do again:

-   Loved getting parents involved over the watch party

## Things we want to change/do better:

-   More communication - we didn't have a parent meeting prior to the event/this year, definitely need to do so more before waterloo
