# Pit Crew - To be improved
- Communication
	- Knowing what is a problem
- Prioritization
- Chairs? (limited space may be an issue)
- More meticulous with packing
	- Less unnecessary items
	- More spare items ([[Neo 550]]s)
- Be more thorough with checks - physically check, manipulate
- Better communication under pressure
- Do checks in line/in queue
- Label more things
	- Especially [[Allen Keys]]
- More idle inspection when [[Pit Crew]] is bored/they have free time
	- Does this look the same as it did before, is it bending, is it square, are there scratches or metal shavings, etc.
- Planning for portable/[[Fieldside Pits]]
	- What to bring
	- Make another tab on packing list
- More post-match communication on repairs & maintenance
- Clear box on part for ALL parts taken off robot to be stored in (default location, minimize things getting lost or left behind)
- Pit crew should be comfortable with doing the system check and doing setpoints (off season or next season)
- Ensuring that restocking between events happens (eg. paper towels, zip ties, spares)
- In queue electrical kit
