3D printing is a type of additive [[Manufacturing]] commonly used in the [[FRC]] community (including on [[Previous 4476 Robots]]) and in industry. As a fast and customizable method of making parts as both prototypes and end-use products

There are four primary methods of 3D printing:
- [[Fused Deposition Modelling]] (FDM)
- [[Selective Laser Sintering]] (SLS)
- [[Stereolithography]] (SLA, or Resin Printing)
- [[Direct Metal Laser Sintering]] (DMLS)

## Printing on 4476

As a team, we have access to several printers owned by various team members. The majority of these printers are [[Fused Deposition Modelling|FDM]] printers. The [[Kingston Robotics Lab]] also has several FDM printers, including a Markforged [Onyx One](https://markforged.com/fr/3d-printers/onyx-one) capable of printing with carbon fiber.

Parts that have been printed on our previous robots include [[Shooter]] hood components in 2020 and 2022, [[Crowned Pulleys]] in 2022 and 2023, as well as our yellow [[Swerve Module]] covers.
