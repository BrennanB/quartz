# Pre-season
## Repeat
- [[Scouting]] workshops
- Training/specialized workshops
- Use kanban board
- Have pit set up

## Start

	- [[Scouting]] workshop--watch old matches, comments
	- [[Strategy]] workshop--understanding what’s important in games
	- Multiple CAD workshops!
	- [[Software]] workshops!
	- [[Electrical]] workshops!
- Ambassador training
- Off season project--climber
- Attempt the CAD-a-thon
- Increase attendance for off season meetings
- Official recruiting program earlier in the year (open houses in spring, repeat and have in September
- School demos at the start of school year
- Add people to [[Slack]] at demos
- Demos at 7&8s schools at the end of school year
- Connect with teachers at demos
- Have a part order in the summer to have materials on hand for build (lexan, plates, tubing, bearings, shaft, SPACERS, etc.)
- Also wood and stuff
- Inspect and repair pit walls
- Better support chassis and elevator
- Simplify as much as possible
- Design so robot cannot go outside size limits
- Have ¼” clearance for size on each side (height, width, length)

## Stop

- Avoid designs with subsystems that can collide if possible

# Kickoff

## Repeat

- Attempt to have local kickoff event again
- See if we can find a free space
- Daily recaps
- Have meetings go through lunch and dinner
## Start
- VR field view to help visualize
- More communication between sub groups (more of a focus on it)
- Have prototype materials ready
- Tape markings for field elements and layout
- Do priority list on morning of day #2
## Stop

- One group reads dimensions/visuals of game manual (and does mock-up)

# Build Season

## Design Stage
### Repeat
- Laser cut prototypes (but do better job of teaching drawings and checking parts over)
- Do a better job of integrating electrical into design
- Periodic design reviews to check things over :)
- Every time a subsystem concept is completed, something big is integrated into a subsystem, or a draft is completed?
- Aim high for design and cut down as needed
- Liked Sport gearboxes
- 3d print encoder connections
- Keep using that IR sensor (buy some)
### Start
- Make sure we have [[Prototyping]] materials on hand before kickoff
- Have [[Design]] leads the same throughout season
- Better protect [[Sensors]] and [[Electrical]] components with designated guards
- Look into better solutions for sensors (see what other teams do, reduce # of potential failure points)
- Sensor redundancy?
#### Electrical
- Don’t splice wires together at the crimp
- Any removable part planned with connections that are done well
- Possibly better wire? Larger Gage?
- Remove strain
- Confirm manufacturing capabilities and time estimates before build season (in-house and sponsors)
- Design with those capabilities in mind, reduce delays
#### Elevator improvements
- Power [[Elevator]] from both sides
- Look into powering it down
- Look into constant force springs (increase speed)
- Define procedure for design decisions
- Design [[Strategy]], overall design, and design leads meet to discuss and decide (if consensus won’t work)
- Have a way to decide how many spares we should order (ranking system) for each part order
- Design with weight in mind from start
#### Purchasing
- Have a Purchasing Officer to organize who orders what, keep track of reimbursements, etc.
- Have google form for individual part orders
- Make sure to update spreadsheet with status
- GrabCAD/CAD
- Have “qualified CAD people”, and anyone who works on CAD has to work with them
- Admins vs members
- Use grabcad locking feature and communicate about what you’re working on
- Maybe lock full robot assembly
- Make sure people use their own users
- Use upload comments!
- Create parts library
- Educate people on folders in grabcad
- Design with maintenance in mind (even more so)
- Look into online CAD software maybe
### Stop
- Avoid spotting holes if not necessary
- Avoid using beefy bolts
- Don’t have so many people doing CAD
## Manufacturing/Assembly Stage
### Repeat
- Subsystem boxes (buy nice boxes for them)
- Good job of squaring things
### Start
- Communicate when parts come in and organize them right away to avoid losing them
- Use part drawings for manufacturing to avoid computer hassle and keep laptops out of shop
	- Maybe have a designated person to make those
	- Print them off
- Do more training with tools (off-season)
- Do visual checks of everything after assembly
- Work 1-1 or small groups with an experienced person
- Bring better workbenches
- Try to make the time to make cad reflect manufacturing changes
## Crescent Trip & Testing
### Repeat
- Asking questions and asking for help
- Team break
- Air B&B staying together
- Have a [[Slack]] channel for communication
- Bring second robot to do defense practice
### Start
- Try to plan who and when will be there earlier on
- Be clear on expectations for who should be there--pit crew and drive team attends unless extenuating circumstances, and anyone else is welcome to come
- Shifts to give people breaks and avoid burnouts
- Plan food in advance
- Look at doing 2 weekends again?
- Make a plan for people who are not in Toronto to keep productivity up
- Get better at debugging
	- Have a checklist or procedure for debugging (avoid simple errors like neglecting to plug something in)
	- Maybe flow chart for failure mode analysis?
- End update with what you tried, what ended up fixing it so that people have a better idea of what might work for future issue
- Work on crisis management — take breaks, recentre, and discuss ideas
- Bring in fresh minds

## No Bag

- Stick to 6-week timeline and use extra time for iteration and testing
## Competitions (Logistics, Organization, Decisions, Dynamics, etc.)
### Repeat
- Keep district event food about the same
- Team dinner in hotel at [[Ontario District Championship]]
- Have someone organize meals for the team
- Have someone organize hotels for the team
### Start
- Negotiate earlier breakfast time on first day (check in)
- Book [[World Championship]] hotel block (everyone at same hotel) right as soon as they open
- Everyone goes to [[World Championship]] Welcome Night together :)
- Team photo on first day at Worlds (set time before event)
- Have parent meeting in December to discuss food and hotel options
- Game while waiting in line for doors to open
- QFRC at same hotel as team
- Get trailer in line 1 hour before load in starts
- Have same people do pit setup every time (robot capable people so they can work on robot right away)
- Have more things on wheels and combine containers (fewer units, fewer trips)
- EVERYONE COME LINE UP EARLY FOR DOORS OPENING
- Assign a designated group to take down pit right after being eliminated
- Have 2 people doing data entry
- Consider more efficient option for scouting (scantron, app, or something else)
- At least 2 specialists for each area (code, mechanical, electrical)

## Competitions (Pit and Performance)

### Robot Design

- Good past understanding of linear slide helped with this year’s ball pickup
- Rigidity improvements for all aspects of the robot
- Sliding hatch mechanism
- Aluminum [[Baseplate]]
- Consider trying welding non-critical parts
- Bumper mounting improvements
## General
- Give people notice if you can’t attend a meeting
- Incentive for showing up and on time
- TAKE BETTER CARE OF TOOLS AND THINGS
- Get more clamps
	- Maybe c clamps
- Get drills
- Look into better riveters (pneumatic or electric maybe)
- Canifier
