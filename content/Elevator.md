## Kickstand

254 created a "kickstand" which was a simple 3d printed hard stop that sprung out of the way after the carriage moved out of the way. This allowed them to start the match at a different height which was closer to the scoring height for [[2023 Charged Up]]. You can find more about it [[28th October 2023 (Saturday)#254 Elevator Kickstand|here]].
