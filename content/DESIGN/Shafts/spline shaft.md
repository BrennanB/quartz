Spline shafts are shafts that have a starlike shape that interface with motor hardware easier than other options like [[keyed shaft]].

[[Motors]] that support Spline shaft are [[Kraken X60]] [[Neo Vortex]] and the [[Falcon 500]]

Keep in mind these motors have different types of spline shaft, including a different diameter and tooth count. [[Pinions]] that work on the Kraken will not work on a Falcon (instead it will damage it!).
