The Neo Vortex is a new [[Brushless Motors|brushless motor]] made by [[REV]] released for the 2023-24 [[FRC]] season. The primary feature of the Vortex motor is the removable and replaceable output shaft.

Available output shafts include:
- MAXSWERVE [[Keyed Shaft]]
- 20DP 7Tooth Gear with 8T [[Center to Center Distance]]
- [[Falcon 500]] compatible
- 8mm [[Keyed Shaft]]
- [[MAXPlanetary]] input kit

These motors are the first to use the replaceable [[Spark Flex]] [[Motor Controller]], which is nice for reparability. 

Details are still coming out, including specifications on encoder resolution.
