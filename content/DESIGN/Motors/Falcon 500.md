The #Falcon500 (aka Falcons) is a brushless motor made by VEX, with an integrated Talon FX motor controller. It came out in 2020 with the intent to "give teams previously unheard of amounts of power and efficiency", and "reduces size, weight, and common failure points of other motors in the market." The [[spline shaft]] was the first of its kind to be produced for FRC purposes.

The Falcon 500 is compatible with #PheonixPro, which is a subscription based service by CTRE to improve motor performance.

While not officially confirmed, it is widely believed to be a discontinued motor. Three versions of the Falcon 500 were made (V1, V2, V3), all of which had assorted manufacturing errors that could cause problems and required teams to make fixes to the product after purchasing (e.g. applying Loctite to screws properly so they didn't fall into the motor and kill the motor). 

Falcons were used by 4476 on robots from 2020-2023.
