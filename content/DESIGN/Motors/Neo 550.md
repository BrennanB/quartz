The #NEO550 (technically called the NEO 550 Brushless Motor, often simply called a 550) is a brushless motor made by [[REV]]. The primary features of the 500 include the small footprint of the motor, taking up less size than previously available options.

Like the [[NEO Brushless V1.1]] there is an integrated motor sensor (3-phase #HallEffect sensors and a motor temperature sensor) in the 550, but it must use an internal [[SparkMAX]] motor controller.
