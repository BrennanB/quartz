The #NEO550 (technically called the NEO 550 Brushless Motor, often simply called a 550) is a brushless motor made by [[REV]]. The primary features of the 500 include the small footprint of the motor, taking up less size than previously available options.

Like the [[NEO Brushless V1.1]] there is an integrated motor sensor (3-phase #HallEffect sensors and a motor temperature sensor) in the 550,  but it must use an either a #SparkMAX [[motor controller]], or, with an adapter board, you can use the #SparkFLEX controller.

Team 4476 began using NEO 550 motors in 2020 #Tanner, and they were also used on the 2022 robot #Leia and in 2023 on #Misha-and-Zoey.
