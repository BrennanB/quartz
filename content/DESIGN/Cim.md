CIM motors used to be the defacto high load motor for primarily drivetrains.

We don't use them anymore in place of [[Brushless Motors]] like [[Kraken X60]], [[Falcon 500]], [[NEO Brushless V1.1]], and [[Neo Vortex]]. All of these motors are similar class type motors with the same kind of mounting sizes.
