# The Robot

![[Pasted image 20231016190138.png]]

The 2015 robot was a [[Chain]] driven single stage [[Elevator]]. It featured a passively deployed can grabber, compliant #Intake, and had a few different tote stacker configurations.

Later on in the season a tether setup was made to stack totes from the [[Human Player]] independently of the robot being there that was inspired from 1325 that same year. The compliant #Intake was also removed later on.
