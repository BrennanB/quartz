## Fun Lore

- This robot was largely rebuilt in a garage in the middle of February as part of the long weekend [[Practice Field Trip]] after taking a huge side-impact
- Originally the robot didn't have a climber on it, so that was added over the duration of the season
- The sponsor panel on one side of the robot just said "Ask us how you can get hat" on it
- We signed up and competed at the North Bay district event with 3 days notice with a crew of 6 students and 3-4 mentors, and stayed in someone's basement for accommodations
- We almost didn't qualify for [[Ontario District Championship]], but then won the [[Engineering Inspiration]] award at our second event for the first time in team history. Then we almost didn't qualify for the [[World Championship]], until we won the [[Engineering Inspiration]] award at Provincials and qualified for the first time since 2017!
