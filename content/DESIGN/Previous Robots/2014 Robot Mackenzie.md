## Team Abilities

2014 was the first year the robot was designed prior to manufacturing. The team had an influx of new strong [[mentor]]s who were alumni of other teams. This year the team invested in a small tabletop [[Drill Press]] and had a few parts that were manufactured by a local engineering firm. The rest of the robot was [[COTS]] or made with simple hand tools much like [[2013 Robot Aunt Jemima]].

## Robot Name

The robot was named after Mackenzie who was a family friend of one of the families on the team. This started our whole partnership with OneMatch and naming our robot after someone in need each year.

The robot was heavily inspired by the [Ri3D team Oryon Labs Robot](https://youtu.be/LSXEHBHmIn0?si=3Gu8ECMJ56mddALE) in overall structure, though much of the actual robot was modified adding other concepts in. Our robot featured a motorized single joint for pivoting the arm up and down, a [[choo choo mechanism]] [[shooter]]. Top rollers and guides to center the yoga ball, and pneumatic arm to add or remove contact with the ball and the top roller during pick up or shooting phases.
