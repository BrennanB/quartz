By default, the procedure to rename files is very clumsy and can cause errors in assemblies. Enabling this setting lets you rename components in the feature tree.

Go to: {Settings -> System Options -> FeatureManager} then check "Allow components to be renamed...".

Now, you can right click on the component's name in the feature tree to rename components. Not only do you no longer have to close SolidWorks to rename a file, SolidWorks will automatically update all references so your assemblies stay happy (and when assemblies are happy, everyone's happy).
