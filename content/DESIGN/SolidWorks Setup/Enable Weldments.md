You can design complex structures made out of aluminum box extrusion, but the result is often a complex assembly that's time consuming to make and hard to adjust. What you may want to use instead are weldments.

Weldments are a set of SolidWorks tools that lets you sketch a path, then generate an extrusion profile that follows your path. For a demonstration of how this works, watch the first 2 minutes of this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8zpMxDt7xc

The first step to getting weldments set up is to download the 4476 Parts Library (Check out the [[CacheCAD Setup]] page for how to add this library). Then, to enable weldments in SolidWorks:
1. Open a new Part in SolidWorks
2. Right click any of the toolbar tabs, hover over "Tabs", and click "Weldments". This makes all the weldments tools accessible
3. Go to \[Settings -> System Options -> File Locations] and select Weldment Profiles under "Show folders for:"
4. Click "Add...", then in the pop-up find the "Weldment Sketches" folder in the 4476 Parts Library and click "Select Folder"
5. Click OK in the settings window and Yes if a message pops up asking to change your search path

You're ready to use WeldmentsWhen using weldments, you'll mainly be using the profiles in \[Weldment Sketches -> 4476 Custom -> Aluminum Box Extrusion], but feel free to check out the hex shaft profiles and 8020 profiles that may come in handy for offseason projects.
