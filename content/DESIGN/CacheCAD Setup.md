**To set up CacheCAD:**
1. Go to https://www.cachecad.com/download and download the latest release
2. Click "Download anyway" when Google Drive's warning page appears (CacheCAD is community made and has not been approved by Microsoft or Google)
3. Open the downloaded "CacheCAD_setup.exe" file
4. If a blue box appears warning you that the file might be harmful, press "More Info" then "Run Anyway" to continue
5. Once downloaded, CacheCAD should open, you can press "next" and then "finish". This will run the setup wizard.
6. CacheCAD will ask you where to store its files. Place wherever you'd like that is not on a cloud (OneDrive, iCloud etc). The default may be okay
7. Open CacheCAD and press "Sign in with Google" and use your @wafflesrobotics.com account to sign in. Make sure to press the check box to allow CacheCAD to have access to your Google Drive

At this point, CacheCAD is fully installed! However, you need to set up the projects to be synced.

**To add a project:**
1. Open whichever folder you would like to add to CacheCAD as a project (e.g. 4476 Parts Library, 2024 Robot) and copy the browser URL
2. Open CacheCAD, click on "New Project", paste the copied URL and click "OK"
3. Your folders are listed on the left. Double click on the project you want to work on
4. A window will appear saying a folder is being created, click "OK"
5. Once CacheCAD finishes loading the project, click on "Download Changes" then "Download Changes" again. It will take a while to download big projects like our parts library, patience is truly a virtue

We recommend that you create a project for the "4476 Parts Library" and for the specific FRC robot for the corresponding season. You may need to create new projects for any other projects.
