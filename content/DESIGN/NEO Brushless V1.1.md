The Neo V1 (technically called the NEO Brushless Motor V1.1, often simply called a Neo) is a brushless motor made by [[REV]]. The first edition of the NEO V1 came out in 2019 and was the first brushless motor designed to meet the unique demands of the FRC community.

As of 2023, NEO V1.1 Motors include additional tapered `#10-32` holes in the shaft and back housing of the motor to allow for increased orientation.

There is an integrated motor sensor (3-phase [[Hall Effect Sensors]]  and a motor temperature sensor) in the NEO, but it must use an either a [[Spark Flex]] [[Motor Controller]] or, with an adapter board, you can use the [[Spark Flex]] controller.

Team 4476 began using NEO motors in 2020 [[2020 Robot Tanner]].
