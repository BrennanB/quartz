The #NEOV1 (technically called the NEO Brushless Motor V1.1, often simply called a Neo) is a brushless motor made by [[REV]]. The first edition of the NEO V1 came out in 2019 and was the first brushless motor designed to meet the unique demands of the FRC community.

As of 2023, NEO V1.1 Motors include additional tapered `#10-32` holes in the shaft and back housing of the motor to allow for increased orientation.

There is an integrated motor sensor (3-phase #HallEffect sensors and a motor temperature sensor) in the NEO, but it must use an either a #SparkMAX [[Motor Controller]] or, with an adapter board, you can use the #SparkFLEX controller.

Team 4476 began using NEO motors in 2020 #Tanner, and they were also used on the 2022 robot #Leia.
