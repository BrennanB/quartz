# Communication

We have several expectations and goals for any [[Pit Crew]] communication. These goals are designed around having the most efficient possible actions as a whole unit.

## Following Chain of Command

- The [[Pit]] area follows a strict chain of command that must be respected. All other members must follow the instructions of the Lead [[Pit Mentor]]s while in the pit.
	- Members who disagree with the instructions of the Lead Pit Mentor must still follow their direction. Raise concerns after the fact through an appropriate lead mentor.
	- If members are unable to do this, the Lead Pit Mentor will ask them to stay out of the pit for the remainder of the day or competition.
- Space is extremely limited in the team’s [[Pit]] area (10’x10’) and on the [[Practice Field]]. Only the [[Pit Crew]] members should be in the these areas, with the following exceptions:
	- the [[Scouting]] or [[Strategy]] teams to relay information only
	- the [[Media]] team to document the team only, with permission of one of the Lead [[Pit Mentor]]s
	- awards students trained in talking to [[Judges]], when they have been called in by the Pit Leads
	- [[Drive Team]] or [[Topping Crew]] members, when they have been called in by the Pit Leads
- Extra [[Mentors]], [[Student]], family members, and guests should remove themselves from the [[Pit]] when not needed. The [[Pit Mentor]] leads will monitor this and ask people to leave as required (don’t take it personally!).
- Do not sit in the [[Pit]] area when there is work to be done or when [[Judges]] are making their rounds. Members should always be ready to jump in and should maintain a professional appearance.
- Food and drink are generally not allowed in the [[Pit]]s, except for bottled water, as per venue rules.
- Do not yell “Robot!” to get people to move out of the way for the robot. Instead, say “excuse me,” politely.
- When meeting a judge or special guest, greet them confidently with eye contact and introduce yourself. When [[Judges]] or the media visit the pit, refer them to a qualified individual or ask them to come back if the respective individuals are unavailable (we only get one shot to make an excellent impression).

- Safety glasses are required at all times. Avoid borrowing a pair of safety glasses from the safety glasses attendants; instead, ask another W.A.F.F.L.E.S. member to get you a pair from the pit or bring your own.
	- Non-safety rated prescription glasses with side shields are not an appropriate substitute for safety glasses.

# We Do Our Best[§](https://wiki.wafflesrobotics.com/Drive-Team-Philosophy#we-do-our-best)

Our goal is to be diligent and prevent issues from occurring in matches, and quickly resolve them if they do occur.

# We are Team Players[§](https://wiki.wafflesrobotics.com/Drive-Team-Philosophy#we-are-team-players)

We work as a team to ensure the robot is in the best possible condition before going out onto the field.
